Penelope Cruz was pregnant while filming it so her sister did a lot of body doubling for her and I think even some of the stunt fight scenes too. Story was just ok and Ian McShane was great as always, but not really used well.\n\nPotC 5 continues 1 year after PotC 4 did and by now it's been 21 years after the events of PotC 3 so Captain Jack Sparrow is in his 50s by now. He doesn't act as well or seems to be as clever as he was before, but it's been 21 years since he lost 2 chances of immortality, his crew again, the black pearl, and was down on his luck again in universe.  Story was meh but it had the return of two glorified cameos of William Turner and Elizabeth Swann with the after credit scene teasing that they were to have a bigger role in the sequel with also Davy Jones return. Javier Bardem was a fun villain and Barbossa again did a great job and was a highlight of the film. The rest of it was meh. Main issue was no real duels. \n\n\n\nOne thing I personally believe that affected Johnny Depp and his lackluster performance for the film was because it was when he was married to Amber Heard. His pinky got injured during production off set and it turns out it was when she threw the vodka bottle at him and severed the tip. He was always an alcoholic, but it definitely got worse during the making of this film since there would be days he wouldn't show up on set and they had to have a crew member stake out his house and call the director to let him know if Johnny was awake yet.\n\nEdit: added Captain",

Then the prequels lead to new breakthroughs and revolutionary CGI effects and usage. \n\n>Following the release of Return of the Jedi in 1983, George Lucas’s commitments to Star Wars, at least in film, were complete. In the intervening years — dubbed “The Dark Times” by fans — Star Wars was largely absent from the public consciousness. Lucas, for his part, spent the time raising his family and somewhat quietly shepherding the evolution of digital effects with Industrial Light & Magic, resulting in innovations like the liquid-metal T-1000 of Terminator 2 (1991) and the mind-blowingly lifelike dinosaurs of Jurassic Park (1993).\n\n>Finally, on November 1, 1994, Lucas sat down to write Episode I.\n\n>George Lucas, The Phantom Menace writer and director, Star Wars creator: Well, my decision to make Episode I was more or less driven by technology. The first three Star Wars films were designed very, very carefully to be done cheaply. We didn’t go to any big cities, we didn’t have a lot of costumes, we didn’t have a lot of extras. We didn’t have a lot of the things that cost money on a movie like that. So it was really driven by what I could afford. You have to remember, the first film was made for 13 million dollars. Today, that same film costs 300 million dollars. Even in those days, 2001 cost like 25 million dollars. And I think we had more special effects than that did.\n\n>With Episode I, I didn’t want to tell a limited story. I had to go into the politics and the bigger issues of the Republic and that sort of thing. I had to go into bigger issues. And in order to do that, I had to come up with a way of doing it, and that’s what digital technology brought me. I had Yoda but he couldn’t fight. I had cities, but I couldn’t build models that big. I had lots and lots of costumes, but I couldn’t afford to make them. So there were a lot of issues that were just practical — Episode I wasn’t doable for a long time, so I waited until we had the technology to do it.",

They were gonna do some pick up shots of him getting on and they forgot to and when they remembered, Bloom was working on another film and had a beard and couldn't return to film it so they had to CGI it instead. It wasn't meant to be like that crazy, but the otherworldly abilities of being an Elf makes it lore friendly. \n\nThis is from the Official Fan Club Magazine where Peter Jackson explained how that scene came to be. \n\n>One of the scenes in The Two Towers that impressed people was the one during the Warg encounter in which Legolas is standing there one minute and then just reaches up and swings himself effortlessly onto a horse. How did you do that?\n\n>That has an interesting story behind it. Legolas is on the ground firing at the Wargs. The rest of the horsemen ride up behind him, and the idea is that he was supposed to leap into the saddle, because he spends the rest of that scene on the back of the horse. The original concept was to have Orlando turn around as the horse [comes up] up behind him with Gimli, then reach out and, in some way, hop up onto the saddle. The way I was going to shoot that was to \"cheat\" it. The shot you see in the film was a wide shot of Orlando standing there; then he does this turn where he starts to reach for the horse. That was as far as that shot was supposed to go in the film. There wasn't supposed to be any more than that.\n\n>Then we were going to do a close-up of Orlando's hand grabbing the saddle, then a close-up of Orlando's foot sticking in the stirrup, and then a close-up of Orlando landing in the saddle. It was all going to be done with two or three quick cuts and a total cheat: Suddenly, you would find him in the saddle. You wouldn't quite know how he got there, because it was going to be done tightly. On the day we started shooting that scene, we did the wide shot you see in the film with Orlando turning and reaching for the saddle. We then got him on his horse because, instead of shooting the close-ups, we were going to move on and shoot some more wide shots and come back to the close-ups. When we started shooting the wide shots of him on the horse, he fell off and cracked a rib. That put Orlando out of action. We weren't able to do any more filming with him for many days, because he had his rib bound up. The trouble with being on any film is that you are on that location for [only] a few days; by the time Orlando was okay to film this stuff, the entire crew had moved on to different scenes. We always thought that we would come back to do a couple of quick shots of Orlando as he lands in the saddle. We went through the rest of the shoot but never got those shots, because we had everything else to shoot. The whole thing was forgotten.\n\n>We wrapped up the film, but I always thought, \"Well, I'll grab those shots of Orlando when we do pick-ups.\" This past year, when we did the pick-ups for The Two Towers, every actor was available except for Orlando. He was doing the Ned Kelly film in Australia. They had him with a little beard and some facial hair, and they wouldn't allow us to grab him for a few days and shave his face, because he was in the middle of shooting, and they needed [that look] for their film. That effectively meant he couldn't participate in the pick-ups, and we couldn't do any new Legolas shots then.\n\n>[in the end], I never got those images of Orlando actually landing in the saddle. I was in the cutting room thinking, \"Oh my God, what the hell am I going to do?! We've got him standing on the ground; he turns around and reaches for the horse. The horse actually goes by him, and he is still standing there. I then have all this stuff of him galloping around on the horse but nothing to show him actually getting on the horse.\" So I had a problem. I looked at the shot of him where he is standing there, the horse is galloping up behind him, and he reaches out, and I thought, \"You know what? At this moment that he turns and reaches, if we then changed him into a CG [computer-generated] guy and animated him grabbing the saddle and swinging up and then painted out the real Orlando - who, on film, just continues standing there as the horses gallop by - we have a CG guy flipping around, doing this incredibly impossible acrobatic stunt. That would be pretty cool and certainly [solve] my problem of getting him on his horse.\" That's what we did. We actually did it because we were forced to do it - it was never a planned event. Orlando thought it was pretty cool, too!",

There have been droids and Ewoks, but that was a long time ago. So he brought out THE CLONE WARS micro-series, and it was super action-packed and exciting and really short installments. And it proved that people wanted to see STAR WARS in a lot of different mediums. **So when we into doing this, I think that, now that George is done with the prequels, he wanted to reestablish the rules a little bit more, like \"Mace Windu can't take out hundreds of battle droids by himself, otherwise the arena on Geonosis would've been a wipeout; [The jedi] would've won, and there be no Clone Wars.** Those are exciting installments, but we don't tie directly into them; we tie more directly into the film that preceded us, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and the one that comes after us, REVENGE OF THE SITH. We take cues from [Tartakovsky's series]. I definitely pay a big homage to them in some of the design look of it. Anakin wears an outfit that was definitely inspired by what we saw in the other CLONE WARS. But there's no direct link-up.\n\n[Source](http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/37720)",

During their first Fight, Grievous was just toying with her. And she still ended up running. Their second Fight? Grievous had her if not for Hondo showing up with the Slave One. I'd hardly count either of these as a victory for Ahsoka over Grievous. More so an escape. \n\nVentress? She was fighting for her live and her people, driven by Anger and hatred, while on a Planet that has a natural connection to the dark side of the force.\n\nGrievous did often cheat during his duels, his Fight against Master Eeth Koth being a prime example. But really, the Magnaguards only stepped in once Koth used the force. You could argue it was Grievous simply evening the odds. That asside though, who said a duel during War had to be honorable? \n\nReally, while Grievous does Lose a lot of fights during the Clone Wars, his defeats all make perfect sense if you bother to think about them for more than two minutes instead of going \"GUNGANS?!?!??!\" -",

Note, however, we do have evolution; the sausage isn't being used in quotes, it's being used visually and not in the context of one of the films.\n\nThibsons original lightsaber meme worked because it harnessed this repetitive energy; a daily repetition with an evolution in the repetition. It's simplicity and predictability worked as an anti-joke, I think. It was funny because it wasn't funny, but I reckon thats not too relevant, the success was due to the format matching its nature; repetition of a simple concept with slight evolution.\n\nThis post is thus a sausage meme, evolved in the way memes do, but its also a callback joke (a well understood and popular rhetorical device in almost all comedy), it's also an unexpected evolution on the very predictable lightsaber meme, thus subverting the original anti joke and making it a traditional joke.\n\nBasically this is like layers of memes and traditional jokes my dude. It's a dumb sausage joke, but that's only one of like 4 things going on here.",

It would a close and interesting battle, to the point where i dont think i can come to a certain conclusion. It could go either way. \n\nThey are equal in Saber combat imo, while they use very different styles. I dont think that the force would play a big part, since Grievous has been shown to be able to evade force attacks, UNLESS Maul can use it in such an unorthodox way that Grievous’ cyborg brain cannot predict it, since that is how he keeps up with Jedi. His brain is essentially a supercomputer custom designed for battle with split millisecond reaction time and tactics.\n\nAt the same time; Mauls double bladed saber would make deflecting 4 lightsabers at once much more manageable, allowing him to maintain an effective offense while still having a reliable defense, since no matter what, one end of his blade will always be a danger to his opponent.",

That being said I think he could hold his own in a duel with Grievous, Maul was able to hold off Qui Gon and Obi-Wan simultaneously and that’s no small feat, I think he’d be plenty capable of disarming Grievous in the same way Obi-Wan did.

Maul was nowhere near Sidious, but he probably could have defeated most Jedi, especially in the era before the Clone Wars, when many Jedi lacked combat experience and *none* had faced a Sith Lord in a millenia",

He's above average in both regards, but hardly \"the best\".\n\nIt's his mind. He represents the peak of Jedi teachings. He's well learned, analytical, and a master of his own mind and emotions. He took everything Qui Gon (the Jedi who saw how the Jedi had lost their way) taught him and everything Yoda (the most powerful, skilled and knowledgeable Jedi there was) taught him and combined them to be the perfect Jedi. He studies hard, he works hard, he's never overconfident, nor does he experience doubt. He knows EXACTLY how those would be weaknesses and how to exploit them. He uses Soresu a style of combat based not around winning through your own design, but surviving long enough for the opponent to make a mistake, and he was a master at that. \n\nGrevious represented a new challenge for him. He used light sabers, but he didn't fight like a Jedi. He had 4 light sabers at once, that could spin like helicopters leaving little to no opening. He was sufficiently machine that he would not easily tire out or make a mistake. He did not use the force or anything that Obi Wan had learned to counter. He was operating on pure strategy and unrelenting attack. He was Obi-Wan's weakness. \n\nAnakin, was the opposite. Obi-Wan knew his strengths and weaknesses inside and out. He knows that Anakin is stronger in the force and a better lightsaber duelist in the sense that if you ran a tournament Anakin would fair better. Obi-Wan's analytical mind, and the fact that he had raised Anakin meant there was absolutely no one that Obi-Wan could fight better against though. He knew every counter to everything Anakin was likely to throw at him because that's exactly what he had been training with. As long as he remained calm, he knew how to stay in the fight against Anakin for as long as Anakin would be able to fight because he did it before, and he knew exactly what mistakes Anakin was most likely to make. And that would be under normal conditions. Anakin was probably at his worst in that fight. He was emotionally chaotic, which is exactly what Obi-Wan knew how to exploit in Anakin, as even normally it's his greatest weakness. But also Anakin was actively switching from light side to dark side in this moment. A decent portion of what he learned as a Jedi wasn't going to work when tried from the Dark side position. At the same time though, he was almost completely inexperienced in any dark side techniques.",

(Sources also say Dooku only included himself out of fear of Grievous’s computing speed, which sometimes overwhelmed Dooku, putting him on the defensive during their sparring matches.) \n\nGrievous beat/forced Windu to flee three times, the last of which Windu sore to never fight him again after he would’ve been beheaded if not for a sudden explosion on the Courscant metro—and the fact the general was quickly honing Vapad. \n\nWindu—the man Lucas himself said defeated Palpatine—lamented such fear and failure to Yoda after the battle of Courscant. \n\nGrievous’ top speed was 20 saber strikes per second, decimating the physical and metaphysical (Force) stamina of even the most seasoned Jedi masters—severing them from the Force almost entirely until it became match only of Man v. Machine, where victory for the metal centipede was only a matter of time. \n\nThat’s why Grievous was taken aback when he lost two hands to Obi, who seemed to only become more powerful with the Force as they continued, the opposite of what Grievous is accustomed to and plans for; even so, Grievous still doesn’t waver—even as clones land en masse behind him—touting Obi with, “Army or not, you are doomed…” \n\nIt isn’t until Grievous loses his sabers after the force push does he finally flee. But, as OP says, even without his sabers, Grievous almost authored the very last moments of Obi-Wan on a fateful ledge on Utapau distant from the main battle. \n\n——\n\n(In fact, Palpatine had planned for Grievous to win. That’s why he originally asked the Jedi council to send Anakin to kill Grievous, knowing the council would disapprove and send Obi instead to impart their own discretion in such matters. Either way, though, whoever died benefited Palpatine, because he needed them both in the mass grave of his machinations.)",

You made these two months some of the best in my life and it was absolutely amazing. I also want to give very special thanks to u/Raymesiris, u/StemmedAxis, u/Black-Forces-God, u/radiakmjs, and u/hotpotatodude. You have engaged in unprecedented ways and were essential to making this meme what it is now.\n\nNow, the decision to end the meme today may come as a shock to most. In fact, I wasn't going to stop today, until I was contacted by the moderators. They explained, in a very heartwarming message, that my posts were an exception to a could-be-seen-as violation of Rule 1(vote manipulation). They asked me to conclude it at day 66, so that this exception would no longer be in place. While a little frustrated, I understood that the rules were there long before me, and it would be unfair to continue opening an exception without good reason. That said, I would also like to thank the moderators for such an opportunity.\n\nI also took the decision to not continue it in a dedicated subreddit. As far as my participation is concerned, this meme belongs to r/prequelmemes. I do, however, give full permission for you guys to continue it in another subreddit(It would probably be important to appoint someone to be in charge).\n\nNow, as for the post itself, I decided to go out with a bang, by effectively doubling the collection at once. I used all of Ray's suggestions, as he was someone who maintained an amazing level of commitment ever since the first few posts. Thank you once again my friend.\n\nI also added in the Jedi Bob lightsaber and the Schwartz Ring, as those were also suggested by very committed and engaged users.\n\nI would like to apologize for all of you who suggested lightsabers in the Suggestion Board and whose suggestion never made it. It wanted to make a \"every suggested lightsaber\" instead, but I simply didn't have enough time. But once again, thank you for your commitment!\n\nNow for some shameless advertising: I invite you guys to check out my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqd1cEseKkmDJh901jSwnA). It doesn't have any content YET, but I will soon release some music covers, arrangements, remixes, and compositions. So if you are into that kind of stuff, subscribe. I will also make a video talking about this whole grievous experience, which should be pretty interesting.\n\nTo conclude, I hope everyone is safe. Stay at home and take care of your elders. These are thought times, and I feel extremely gratified to know I made it a little bit better for many of you. You sure did my time a lot more fun!\n\nPs: This isn't a goodbye! I'll still be active in the subreddit, and posting memes whenever an idea pops into my head!\n\nEdit: Fun Fact the file size was so big Reddit wasn’t accepting it, so I had to decrease the quality.\n\nEdit 2: RIP my inbox\n\nEdit 3: Anyone wanna calculate the amount of coins spent on this post?",

Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

He led from the front and could even kill Jedi himself.\n\nI forget which \"Republic Commando\" book it was (it had to have been \"Triple Zero\" or \"True Colors\"), but at some point the Null ARC Troopers point out that the CIS had the resources and the factories to churn out enough battle droids and droid starfighters that there was literally no reason why the CIS hadn't overwhelmed the Republic (of course, they weren't aware of Palpatine's plan).\n\nIf you combine the potentially limitless resources and manufacturing capabilities of the CIS, the already widespread discontent with the Republic, the leadership of General Grievous and remove Palpatine's sabotage, I don't why how the CIS could have ever lost the Clone Wars.",

And then that promise of training, knowledge and *power* is taken away with the death of Obi-Wan after he thought he was finally on the up and up (successful rescue of princess, escape to ship.). He did break down at an inopportune time, but he had been suppressing all that pain and anguish with the hope of actually doing something about it. Luke pulled himself back together pretty fast for the circumstances he was in, I believe.\n\nThis is a mole hill I'm willing to die on!",

There is no “standard issue” lightsaber outside of training sabers, which these clearly are not. \n\nThis is just an example of vfx artists either cutting corners to save time thinking no one would notice, or putting in placeholders and forgetting to fix them because it looked fine as is.\n\n-Edit: fixed a typo",

It goes on just long enough that I got a chuckle out of it, mainly from one character with a beard and moustache also impersonating her. Idk why, just found that part of the bit funny. So fast forward, I finish episode 1, begin episode 2 and it begins with the attempted assassination of Padmé when her ship arrives. I'm thinking to myself, \"o ya this scene is actually pretty dark in the movie, how will they handle this?\" Well the ship blows up, Padmé runs up to the decoy Padmé and it's the same fucking moustached Lego guy. I fucking lost it.\n\nThis game has handled it's humor really weirdly tbh. Sometimes it's too childish and out of place, and sometimes it's almost too adult. I can't remember what part specifically made me think the latter, I'm still barely on EP 2 but ya the game is fucking wild so far.",

Much simpler and easier to pull a trigger without much thought.\n\nThus, the lightsaber is a more civilized weapon for a most civilized age.

He's above average in both regards, but hardly \"the best\".\n\nIt's his mind. He represents the peak of Jedi teachings. He's well learned, analytical, and a master of his own mind and emotions. He took everything Qui Gon (the Jedi who saw how the Jedi had lost their way) taught him and everything Yoda (the most powerful, skilled and knowledgeable Jedi there was) taught him and combined them to be the perfect Jedi. He studies hard, he works hard, he's never overconfident, nor does he experience doubt. He knows EXACTLY how those would be weaknesses and how to exploit them. He uses Soresu a style of combat based not around winning through your own design, but surviving long enough for the opponent to make a mistake, and he was a master at that. \n\nGrevious represented a new challenge for him. He used light sabers, but he didn't fight like a Jedi. He had 4 light sabers at once, that could spin like helicopters leaving little to no opening. He was sufficiently machine that he would not easily tire out or make a mistake. He did not use the force or anything that Obi Wan had learned to counter. He was operating on pure strategy and unrelenting attack. He was Obi-Wan's weakness. \n\nAnakin, was the opposite. Obi-Wan knew his strengths and weaknesses inside and out. He knows that Anakin is stronger in the force and a better lightsaber duelist in the sense that if you ran a tournament Anakin would fair better. Obi-Wan's analytical mind, and the fact that he had raised Anakin meant there was absolutely no one that Obi-Wan could fight better against though. He knew every counter to everything Anakin was likely to throw at him because that's exactly what he had been training with. As long as he remained calm, he knew how to stay in the fight against Anakin for as long as Anakin would be able to fight because he did it before, and he knew exactly what mistakes Anakin was most likely to make. And that would be under normal conditions. Anakin was probably at his worst in that fight. He was emotionally chaotic, which is exactly what Obi-Wan knew how to exploit in Anakin, as even normally it's his greatest weakness. But also Anakin was actively switching from light side to dark side in this moment. A decent portion of what he learned as a Jedi wasn't going to work when tried from the Dark side position. At the same time though, he was almost completely inexperienced in any dark side techniques.",

(Sources also say Dooku only included himself out of fear of Grievous’s computing speed, which sometimes overwhelmed Dooku, putting him on the defensive during their sparring matches.) \n\nGrievous beat/forced Windu to flee three times, the last of which Windu sore to never fight him again after he would’ve been beheaded if not for a sudden explosion on the Courscant metro—and the fact the general was quickly honing Vapad. \n\nWindu—the man Lucas himself said defeated Palpatine—lamented such fear and failure to Yoda after the battle of Courscant. \n\nGrievous’ top speed was 20 saber strikes per second, decimating the physical and metaphysical (Force) stamina of even the most seasoned Jedi masters—severing them from the Force almost entirely until it became match only of Man v. Machine, where victory for the metal centipede was only a matter of time. \n\nThat’s why Grievous was taken aback when he lost two hands to Obi, who seemed to only become more powerful with the Force as they continued, the opposite of what Grievous is accustomed to and plans for; even so, Grievous still doesn’t waver—even as clones land en masse behind him—touting Obi with, “Army or not, you are doomed…” \n\nIt isn’t until Grievous loses his sabers after the force push does he finally flee. But, as OP says, even without his sabers, Grievous almost authored the very last moments of Obi-Wan on a fateful ledge on Utapau distant from the main battle. \n\n——\n\n(In fact, Palpatine had planned for Grievous to win. That’s why he originally asked the Jedi council to send Anakin to kill Grievous, knowing the council would disapprove and send Obi instead to impart their own discretion in such matters. Either way, though, whoever died benefited Palpatine, because he needed them both in the mass grave of his machinations.)",

Badass.\n\nEDIT how could I forget, the Tartakovsky' Grievous used also feet to fight (also grabbing lightsabers), I would totally see this version using also Trákata tricks, the fight scene from animated Clone Wars is my favorite one\n\nEDIT 2 - i rewatched the scene and hey, Grievous totally made something similar - look from [3:43](https://youtu.be/WIj7gIDFDe4) he put his arm up, made K'Kruhk focus on blades (lightsaber still up in air), changed K'Kruhk's stance and grabbed lightsaber from the air just to make one final death strike, Grievous definitely had Trákata vibes in that fight!",

Teeming masses of humans with cameras awaited the shuttle; the increase in personnel was noticeable. Venlil journalists were squeezed right next to the formidable beasts, and didn’t pay their counterparts much attention. They must have done extensive work with Terrans, to be so casual.\n\nSeveral individuals in the UN’s baby blue welcomed the new species, and offered polite introductions. Their eyes were concealed in floral-colored visors, which was a clear attempt to look as non-threatening as possible. They paused as they saw the Sivkit diplomat bolt away from the crowd; Axsely’s snowy pelt vanished into the thick bushes around the governor mansion.\n\nAmbassador Noah took a step in that direction, as though he wanted to follow her. I placed a paw on his arm, and shook my head.\n\n“Chasing after her will only make it worse. At any rate, we need to speak with your people, immediately,” I muttered.\n\nConcern flickered in his brown eyes. “Is something wrong? You’ve been…subdued. You learned something, when they answered.”\n\nAs soon as we entered FTL-communication range, I had relayed word of the Federation delegation through government channels. Chauson patched up the ship enough to travel, but affirmed that the cooling shaft showed signs of external tampering. I didn’t convey those details over the network, since I didn’t want the UN embassy’s greeting to involve guns and interrogation.\n\nThe Venlil government brought Terran officials into the loop, and related some startling developments in the Gojid war. However, the immediate concern was that both parties seemed surprised by our contact. That meant Recel’s ship never reached its destination. With our lengthy delay, they should have arrived well before we crossed Venlil space.\n\nAt my request, the Terrans deployed a search-and-rescue team to follow their flight path. I kept the knowledge to myself, to avoid a panic, but the worry was nagging at me. What would happen to our relations with those six species, if something had gone wrong?\n\nMy ears pressed back against my head. “I learned several things, which are all troubling. Let me brush off the media, and then, we will join Kam in the briefing room.”\n\nThe camera-wielding primates drew closer with a clamor, and Venlil yipped questions as well. My instincts protested allowing noisy predators to crowd me in every direction; the humans were more aggressive than I was used to, with our own reporters. I breathed a silent sigh of relief, as they granted enough space for us to pass.\n\n*I think some of the human journalists’ bad habits…their ambush tactics, have rubbed off on these Venlil. Stars.*\n\n“I politely request that you lower the volume of your speech, especially when you are this close. My ears are more sensitive than yours, and it carries more intimidation than I believe you intend,” I barked to the microphones.\n\nThe crescendo of Terran questions died down, which lessened the encounter’s intensity. At least if they were all badgering us, someone had the good sense to tell them to avoid the new diplomats. We might have other visitors running into the foliage, if this ensnarement was attempted on anyone else.\n\n“What happened at the Federation summit?” an insistent voice called out.\n\n“I am behind on everything that’s happened in the past month, so I’m not taking general questions right now,” I said, forcing a level cadence. “For now, you can report to Earth that 11 species offered to open diplomatic relations with you.”\n\n“Only 11?”\n\n“Noah Williams, how was your treatment at their hands?”\n\n“Is the rest of the Federation at war with humanity?”\n\n“How do you think this will affect human-Venlil relations?”\n\n“LET ME FINISH!” I spat. “Over 100 species voted to ally with you against the Arxur. An even larger sector are either undecided, or opted for an isolationist policy. While these may not be the results you hoped for, I see them as a positive step forward, from wishing your species extinct. However—”\n\n“The Krakotl fleet are amassing warships, with support from several neighbors, in every border station that faces our space. How can we trust that these public stances aren’t intended as deception?”\n\n“You might find your questions resolved, if my answers could reach their conclusion,” I growled with frustration. “I was about to explain that 38 member states would not budge on their extermination position, and may seek a war of extinction. The Krakotl were one of these…a rather vocal one.”\n\nAgitated whispers cycled through the crowd. I knew there was the half-second it’d take the humans to process that information, before they’d launch into a new inquisition. The questions would fall into predictable categories; how Earth should defend itself from these threats, if diplomatic resolutions were off the table, and what assistance the Venlil would provide.\n\n“I am going to discuss with your generals and my generals how to handle this now. Perhaps our new allies will help us.” I swished my tail toward the Zurulian diplomat, who had settled down atop a human’s shoe. The predator looked taken aback, but didn’t move his foot. “No matter what, we will figure this out together. The Venlil will stand with humanity to the end. Now, excuse me.”\n\nNoah grinned as he saw my irritated head shakes. The Terran ambassador clasped his hands behind his back, and followed me into the governor’s mansion. There was something in his eyes, beyond amusement, as his gaze bored into my skull. It almost came off as predatory hunger, though for some reason, it wasn’t unnerving.\n\nThe human held open the door, his stare never faltering as we walked into the briefing center. That unblinking fixation was distracting; I wasn’t sure if I wanted to tell him to break eye contact. It took a colossal effort to recall the planet-threatening reasons we were here.\n\nGeneral Kam leapt from his chair. “Governor, Ambassador! We’re all delighted you’re back.”\n\nI took a seat next to him, and the predator settled beside me. “I would say it’s good to be back, but…in the month I’ve been gone, the Gojid cradle was glassed?!”\n\n“What?” Noah hissed. “Please, don’t tell me we did that.”\n\nFrom his dejected tone, it seemed he considered that well within the realm of possibility. My certainty, that there was another explanation, wavered after his response. The UN’s position against civilian casualties seemed set in stone, at that initial briefing. Perhaps Meier was just saying what we wanted to hear, so he could obtain our aid.\n\n“The Arxur took advantage of the defenses being down. There was nothing we could do,” General Jones, of the American clan, growled. “We lost a considerable amount of our own troops, trying to evacuate civilians.”\n\nI lowered my gaze. “And the civilians you did evacuate are where?”\n\n“Earth. Mostly refugee camps in New York.”\n\nMy eyes about bulged out of my skull. The humans thought it was a good idea, to take a bunch of terrified refugees to a predator’s homeworld, far away from their own territory? Those Gojids must be overwhelmed, and the optics of this were atrocious. It would’ve been a better solution to host them on Venlil Prime, or transport them to a Gojid colony.\n\nGeneral Zhao narrowed his eyes. “Governor, you look displeased. Do you not trust humans to be proper caregivers?”\n\n“You misunderstand. Candidly, this is an absolute disaster,” I grumbled. “52 species specified they were waiting for news from the cradle, to determine their diplomatic position. When they hear it’s been destroyed…”\n\n“They’ll blame humanity. She’s right. I wouldn’t be surprised if they accused us of coordinating with the Arxur,” Noah finished.\n\nA sigh slipped from my lips. “The refugees are the ‘cherry on top’, as you say. When they hear you’re keeping them in camps on Earth, they’ll assume you’re keeping them as cattle.”\n\n“We have troves of footage, showcasing our humanitarian efforts,” the Chinese general objected.\n\n“And? It’s easy enough to dismiss that as staged propaganda. I bet anything, the Krakotl will use this to gain public support for their attack. To smear you as slaving predators.”\n\nHell, what was stopping the species on-world from rescinding their diplomatic offer? The Mazic president was going to flip when he learned of the cradle’s destruction. This was a grave setback to our progress with the friendly governments, and it would push most undecided factions toward animosity.\n\nAt least I’d had a few hours, to deliberate how to react to various scenarios; this was all news to Noah. The Terran ambassador shifted beside me, and I could sense his surprise to the war’s developments. After witnessing the hatred on the Federation floor, he knew better than anyone I was right about their perspective.\n\n“The Secretary-General understood the cradle’s importance, as a propaganda tool,” Jones said. “That’s why we sent our first fleet on a liberation mission. We have a chance to defeat the Arxur, and retake the cradle. Those mission logs, and the footage which Captain Sovlin provided to us from Gojid media sources, might help mitigate any reputational damage.”\n\nTwo items leapt out at me from that statement. The first being, the humans sent a large contingent of the Venlil ships that were donated to them to a slaughter. Attacking the Arxur was a foolhardy play, which I can’t believe General Kam didn’t object to. Predators or not, the UN had succumbed at every turn to the grays’ superior army.\n\n*Are they trying to leave both of our planets exposed? To lose everything we gave them?*\n\nSince the fleet was already dead, there was no point even addressing that matter. I began to wonder if allying with humanity was a mistake; I hadn’t thought they were suicidal.\n\nThe second topic was the name Sovlin, which I couldn’t be hearing right. Even under excruciating interrogation, it was tough to picture that Gojid giving humanity anything helpful. Had they captured him during the war? What terrible retribution had they inflicted, to make him violate his principles?\n\n“Sovlin is in your custody?” I blinked with concern, as the human representatives nodded. “Is he alive?”\n\nJones rolled her eyes. “Yes. Why does everyone ask that?”\n\n“Because we wouldn’t blame you for killing him, General. I might venture he deserves the ultimate penalty. But how did he come into your possession?”\n\n“He turned himself in, after witnessing our soldiers fight back against the Arxur.”\n\n“I, er…I see. Would it be an unreasonable request to ask for Sovlin to stand trial in a Venlil court? I would like him to answer for reckless endangerment, and mistreatment of a Venlil citizen.”\n\n“The UN is willing to discuss extradition, but he is a valuable strategic asset now. I don’t see him being handed over for a few years.” A female voice I didn’t recognize piped up. This predator was seated away from the generals, and bore the keen visage of intelligence. “Erin Kuemper, UN Secretary of Alien Affairs. Formerly with SETI.”\n\nThat agency name rang a bell in my head. Humans desired friends among the stars, long before their species was interstellar; stories about aliens were abnormally prevalent in their culture. Some Terran scientists devoted their careers to scanning the skies for signals, and cataloguing exoplanets that might be habitable.\n\nNoah and Sara’s flight on the *Odyssey* was charted by SETI researchers. Venlil Prime happened to be the fifth “Earth-like” world on their candidate list. It made sense that those prescient astronomers would try to become the first alien experts and attachés.\n\nI flicked my ears with politeness. “Nice to meet you, Madam Secretary. I understand humans have the greatest claim to Sovlin, of course, but I don’t want his treatment of Slanek to be overlooked. It’s a bad precedent.”\n\n“Agreed. I think it’s a good idea, for us to write out travel and extradition treaties. We’ve relied too heavily on goodwill between our species. This would nip any misunderstandings in the bud.”\n\nThere were a lot of other details that needed to be ironed out; trade, borders, intelligence sharing, joint military bases, and which foods were allowed within our domain. It was a daunting task, since I had no idea how predators approached such matters. That fact that Earth technically fell in Venlil territory was a grievous issue I’d been tiptoeing around.\n\n*The official status, galaxy-wide, is that humanity does not own their homeworld. We do, even if we renounce that stake between our two species.*\n\nOf course, the Venlil Republic would never lay claim to the Sol system. The unfortunate reality was that we didn’t have the authority to hand out parsecs of space. The Federation would be hesitant to sign off on any territorial claims, and that was the best-case scenario. Recognizing the United Nations as a legitimate, spacefaring entity would be acknowledging humans as equals; encouraging them to spread throughout the galaxy.\n\nI feared that our predator friends wouldn’t take kindly to that fact, especially as they eyed colonial expansion initiatives. Decorous as humanity were, I didn’t think they’d be happy sharing with their neighbors forever. They would want some breathing room, and space to call their own.\n\n“Speaking of misunderstandings,” Ambassador Noah rumbled. “Myself, and any human-allied species, might have a target on our back. It appears our shuttle was sabotaged, and that almost resulted in a catastrophic drive failure.”\n\nGeneral Jones chuckled. “I’m amazed the xenos have the stones to think of subterfuge. They sure haven’t shown it before now.”\n\n“The Venlil have risked their entire existence to protect ours. Is that not courageous? Let’s not insult our friends.” Secretary Kuemper shot the American a warning look, then gave me an apologetic smile. “I’m sure that was not her intention, Governor.”\n\n“No offense taken. But as Noah is about to mention, there was a second ship of representatives coming here. You sent out a search party already?”\n\nThe astronaut’s eyebrows shot up. He must be stunned that I had discerned his thoughts with a half-glance. It was uncanny, at times, how I felt like I could sense what was on that predator’s mind.\n\n“Venlil and humans are scouring the edges of Zurulian space now. We expect them back in comms range, within the next few hours,” Zhao answered.\n\nKuemper tilted her head. “Is there something more you wanted from us?”\n\n“We would like the Yotul diplomat pulled aside for questioning, at the earliest convenience. He had an uncanny amount of knowledge about the defect. But please, do so with tact. Without drawing outside attention.”\n\nThe human officials shared a glance, before consulting the encyclopedia of known species on their holopads. It must be difficult, to recall the nuances and details of three hundred races they’d never met before. Perhaps a full briefing, on the friendly visitor races, should be led by our diplomatic corps.\n\nGeneral Kam cleared his throat. “I’ll tell Venlil police to collect him, since you want it to slip under the radar.”\n\n“Thank you. And listen, media silence for now,” I said. “We don’t need this playing out in the court of public opinion.”\n\nKuemper nodded. “I second that. Talk of conspiracies will sour any good news.”\n\nSilence fell over the room, as my military advisor forwarded the request to the appropriate agencies. The Terrans were browsing the Yotul’s file, and seemed to home in on the details of their uplifting. It was easy to forget how new humans were to the galactic scene. As predators, they rarely seemed unprepared for anything.\n\nMy eyes fell on my holopad, awaiting the call that would bring news. It was unknown what happened to Recel and his passengers, but there was a sinking feeling in my stomach when I thought about it. Our interspecies relations were in a delicate position, to begin with; a tragedy was the last thing humanity needed.\n\nIt was in our best interest to hope the Kolshian pilot got lost.\n\n\\---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wng6oa/the_nature_of_predators_36/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wt80ql/the_nature_of_predators_38/)\n\n*Early chapter access* *on* [*Patreon*](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15) | *Species glossary* *on* [*Series wiki*](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_nature_of_predators)",

How much involvement, if any, does the uplift have?\n\nIt also remains to be seen what impact the Gojid war will have on the Federation as a whole. Human media did suggest the Krakotl are gearing up for an attack on Earth. How should humanity respond?\n\nAs always, thank you for reading! Part 38 should be here on Saturday.",

I can’t wait until word gets back that not only are they not dead yet, they have scored the biggest victory in the history of the Federation’s war. Having reclaiming a taken homeworld, rescued an entire ship full of what would have been a cattle ship, AND captured the crew of said ship for interrogation and more information on the Arxur. I can’t wait to hear more of that fight because if we happen to rescue the Gojid leadership holed up in some sort of bunker than we’ll suddenly have another very big supporter given the message they sent out was able to convince Sovlin of all people that he was wrong about us.",

The unfortunate reality was that we didn’t have the authority to hand out parsecs of space. The Federation would be hesitant to sign off on any territorial claims, and that was the best-case scenario. Recognizing the United Nations as a legitimate, spacefaring entity would be acknowledging humans as equals; encouraging them to spread throughout the galaxy.  \n  \nHonestly, I think this could work in our favor.  Play up our status as a protectorate within Venlil territory, or hell, even make us Venlil citizens.  We can worry about independence after the Arxur have been stopped.  As far as being recognized as a \"legitimate, spacefaring entity,\" we can argue that it's a moot point, because currently, we are part of the Venlil Republic, which **is** all that.  After the war, if they want to \"allow\" one of their subject worlds to become independent, well, that is entirely an internal matter, without regard to any of the Federation's whims.  :D \n  \nI doubt we would object to the Venlil building a settlement on Earth, but even if they didn't, we need to drive the point home to the Krakotl that they, and any who would join them, would be declaring war against the Venlil by declaring war against Earth.  That *might* just be enough to get some to reconsider.  \n  \nI, for one, welcome our cute, fuzzy little overlords...  :p",

Some ships are a lot closer to the carrier than 200 Miles obviously, but spreading out means a few thing: \n\n1. You can detect and attempt to intercept ASM earlier, and if the intercept fails you have more time to try again. \n\n2. During the cold war and probably today as well Russia planned to sink CSGs by blowing a nuclear bomb in the middle of the CSG. But, since the ship's are so spread out one nuclear bomb might very well not kill the entire strike group, maybe even not more than one ship. \n\nThere are other reasons as well but not really relevant. \n\n>I wouldn't call that nothing 😅 And you have to think about that fighters aren't a one use throw away weapon. But i get what you mean. What good is your money if you're to dead to spend it.\n\nIf you are using it to kill a ship worth billions of dollars then yeah it's basically nothing. If it costed you less to kill that ship than it costed them losing it, it's inherently a win. \n\nPlus that's 28 million in today's money, that's really cheap for what it gets you. But when you are talking about conflict between spacefraring nations and the resources they have access to than That's less than cheap, dirt might cost more.",

The details are greatly appreciated, how mace windu crushes him to give grievous his signature cough, count dooku recommending he should retreat at times, the Vader visions and of course the battle on Yavin IV.\n\nGrievous in Rots while impressive only gets his moment in the spotlight very briefly and in the 3D clone wars show he becomes a bit of a “villain of the week” but still having his moments. My favourite quote of his from the 3D show is: *“I do not care about your politics! I don't care about your, Republic! I only live to see you die!\"* Grievous didn’t care about governing power or otherwise ruling the Galaxy, his sole purpose was to destroy the Jedi.\n\nThe 2D show turns Grievous into a legitimate horror movie villain creating shock whenever he appears from the initial appearance taking on the 5 stranded jedi and wiping the floor with them to the attack on Coruscant where Shaak Ti panics just by hearing his footsteps again. Then when he does appear after creeping into the scene he is a pure devastating force.\n\nI hope this version of clone wars being redistributed may lead to other artistic interpretations of Star Wars stories in the animated short form. Basically just give Genndy Tartakovsky everything he’d need for another round of this show potentially based in the OT or sequels.",

Basically it’s stories that are really fun and really exciting, but they’re a view on Star Wars, not necessarily canon to him. That was the way it was from the day I walked into Lucasfilm with him all through Clone Wars, everything we worked on, he felt the Clone Wars series and his movies were what was actually the reality of it all, the canon, then there was everything else. So it wasn’t a big dynamic shift for me mentally when there was this big announcement saying the EU is now Legends.

There have been droids and Ewoks, but that was a long time ago. So he brought out THE CLONE WARS micro-series, and it was super action-packed and exciting and really short installments. And it proved that people wanted to see STAR WARS in a lot of different mediums. So when we into doing this, I think that, now that George is done with the prequels, he wanted to reestablish the rules a little bit more, like \"Mace Windu can't take out hundreds of battle droids by himself, otherwise the arena on Geonosis would've been a wipeout; [The jedi] would've won, and there be no Clone Wars. Those are exciting installments, but we don't tie directly into them; we tie more directly into the film that preceded us, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and the one that comes after us, REVENGE OF THE SITH. We take cues from [Tartakovsky's series]. I definitely pay a big homage to them in some of the design look of it. Anakin wears an outfit that was definitely inspired by what we saw in the other CLONE WARS. But there's no direct link-up.\n\n>-[Dave Filoni, 2008.](http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/37720) \n\n>Ryan: Speaking of your version of “Clone Wars,” does it bother you that there’s another one and that the one you did seems to no longer be canon?\n\n>Tartakovsky: Yeah. I mean, you know, of course it bothers me. But, you know, it’s George’s characters. It’s his world and he has to do what he has to do. And the new ones are totally inspired by what we did: A lot of the same character designs and stuff. \n\n>-[Genndy Tartakovsky, ‘Hotel Transylvania’ Director, On The Disappearance Of His Version Of ‘Star Wars: Clone Wars’, 2012.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/genndy-tartakovsky-hotel-transylvania_n_1884046)",

            "text": "Peter Thiel (founder of PayPal and Palantir) just published a long review of four books (Francis Bacon's *New Atlantis*, Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels*, Alan Moore's *Watchmen*, and Eiichiro Oda's *One Piece*). The *Watchmen* section appears third, a little over halfway through the essay.\n\nLink [here](https://firstthings.com/voyages-to-the-end-of-the-world/).\n\nThiel reads these books through a Christian, eschatological lens and argues that they center on the biblical Antichrist. He believes Moore drew heavily upon scripture and theology to depict Adrian Veidt as a type of Antichrist.\n\nI've excerpted his *Watchmen* commentary below. (Be advised: Thiel spoils the ending of the *Watchmen* comic, and the full essay has *One Piece* spoilers up to chapter 1138). What do you think?\n\n>Two decades later, to awaken a world sleepwalking into Armageddon, Alan Moore wrote the superhero comic *Watchmen* (1986–87), a late-modern illustration of the Antichrist. *Watchmen* unfolds in a parallel timeline. The Cold War rages on, liberal internationalism appears politically dead, and in 1985, the year the series begins, Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term as president.\n\n>Moore’s superheroes are “watch men” in two senses: They watch over the world, and they are men of our final hour. A “grievous vision” in the book of Isaiah, from which Moore took his ­title, combines these two meanings: “For thus the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth” (Isa. 21:2, 6). Isaiah’s watchman sees the apocalyptic fall of Babylon, and from the opening, bloody panels of *Watchmen*, the same fate seemingly awaits Moore’s world. Every issue of *Watchmen* ends with a doomsday clock ticking toward midnight. In a nuclear age, Moore’s superheroes are faintly ridiculous. Except for one, they have no superpowers. But these ­high-agency individuals are dangerous, too. “Who watches the watchmen?” chant public protestors, quoting Juvenal. In response, the Keene Act of 1977 outlawed superheroes. When the story begins, somebody is murdering the watchmen, one by one.\n\n>*Watchmen*’s only hero with superpowers is ­Jonathan Osterman, a nuclear physicist. A laboratory accident transformed Osterman into “Doctor Manhattan,” a being capable of manipulating subatomic matter and seeing through time, a synthesis of artificial general intelligence and a thermo­nuclear weapon. Manhattan’s very existence intensifies the apocalyptic logic of late modernity. If the threat of Manhattan cannot de-escalate the Cold War, Moore wonders, then what can?\n\n>*Watchmen*’s narrator is Rorschach, a hardboiled superhero somewhere between Bruce Wayne and Ayn Rand. By day, Rorschach is an apocalyptic street ­crier, half-convinced the world deserves its fate. But he believes in good and evil. The deaths of Rorschach’s fellow superheroes disturb him, and he decides to investigate. To Moore’s frustration, the Manichaean Rorschach is his most popular character.\n\n>*Watchmen* slips between timelines, settings, and literary genres. Recurring symbols lend the story its otherwise faint linearity. We sense that Rorschach’s investigation is tied to the fate of the world. Eventually, we are proven right: Rorschach discovers that Adrian Veidt, a billionaire ­industrialist, is behind the killings and organized a botched attempt on his own life as a false flag.\n\n>Veidt is a type of Antichrist. His superhero moniker is Ozymandias, the Greek name for the Egyptian Pharaoh Rameses II and an allusion to Percy Shelley’s poem (“Ozymandias”). As a young man, Ozymandias smoked Tibetan hashish and dreamed of surpassing Alexander the Great by uniting the world. He is a self-proclaimed pacifist and vegetarian, in some ways more Christian than Christ and the sort of figure who might “deceive the very elect.\"\n\n>To take over the world, Veidt stages a fake alien invasion. On a paradisal island like Bensalem, he builds a giant, telekinetic “alien” and drops it onto a concert by a band named Pale Horse (Rev. 6:8), killing millions in New York City. The Americans and Soviets establish a world government to protect the planet. Rorschach learns of Veidt’s plan only after it has succeeded, and he resolves to tell the world what happened, even at the risk of ending the armistice. “There is good and evil,” says Rorschach, “and evil must be punished. Even in the face of Armageddon I shall not compromise in this.” The otherwise meditative Doctor ­Manhattan disagrees and kills Rorschach. As though to trigger Christian readers, Manhattan then walks on water. Posters celebrating “One World, One Accord” announce Veidt’s victory: Earth is peaceful and safe. Veidt helps New York to rebuild and emblazons the Veidt Enterprises logo across the city (see Rev. 13:17).\n\n>Moore’s great achievement is his updating of Bacon’s pro-science Antichrist for late modernity. Our nuclear world produces endless Hollywood sci-fi dystopias and no longer believes that Baconian science can bring about “peace and safety.” Ozymandias knows that the way to secure power is to scare us about the future. Moore might resist the comparison, but he agrees with Carl Schmitt, who obsessed over the Pauline epistles and doubted that “humanity” could unite behind a political project, “because it has no enemy, at least not on this planet.”\n\n>*Watchmen* triumphs as literature and fails as philosophy or theology. Moore can only ask, not answer, Juvenal’s question, “Who watches the watchmen?” For in Moore’s godless world, the question begets an infinite regress. Who watches the sponsors of the Keene Act? Who watches Nixon? Before *Watchmen* concludes, it seems that Veidt, the great man to end all great men, has solved the problem. But in ­*Watchmen*’s final panels, Rorschach’s diary exposing Veidt’s plot sits in the submissions pile of a newspaper. Doctor Manhattan tells Veidt that “nothing ever ends,” suggesting that Moore’s Ozymandias will share the fate of Shelley’s, and of the biblical ­Antichrist. But in the Bible, God ends the suffering (Matt. 24:22). For Moore and Shelley, the only salvation is the impermanence of things. Though he loves antiquity, Veidt is an early modern like Bacon, who hoped to conquer chance and establish a new Earth once and for all. The late modern Moore has given up on this project. He rejects Christ and, ambivalent about Antichrist, resigns himself to fatalism.\n\n>One final detail in *Watchmen* bears mentioning. In Moore’s alternate history, superheroes threaten public order. As the apocalypse approaches, readers abandon superhero comics for pirate comics, particularly a series entitled *Tales of the Black Freighter*. Like superheroes, pirates are daring and individualistic. Unlike superheroes, they use their powers for evil. Or, more accurately, they use their powers to defy the ruling authorities. One man’s superhero, Moore says, is another government’s pirate.",

                    "text": "The Christian Antichrist comparison here adds nothing that Moore didn’t make blatantly obvious, and Thiel’s deeper reading into the connection is a stretch. Pair that with his false binary between a belief in Christ vs fatalism and it becomes clear he just wanted to make it about his opinion that Christianity is the only correct worldview and that maybe the end is nigh if you don’t do things that put money in his pocket.\n\nHe also seems to think it’s a mistake that Moore chooses not to answer the core question of the novel. Like no dude, the *point* is that no one knows the answer. In the face of nuclear annihilation, one guy (who means well but is high on his own supply) takes it upon himself to give us a common enemy at the cost of many human lives, and it works. Was it worth it? Was he right? Does the truth need to come out, even if it means dropping the world into chaos again? It’s about the reader and getting them to question their worldview. “Moore can only ask” is a dumbass line because no dude, any third grader could *say* an answer to this question, and maybe not being so arrogant as to think you always know what’s right is part of the point here man. Watchmen doesn’t “fail as philosophy” because it’s not fucking *trying* to be a philosophy.\n\nOverall you can tell Thiel is generally well-read and recognizes some of the connections Moore is making, but he’s also a pompous ass-hat who assumes the absence of an answer is always an opening for him to insert the “right” one.\n\n\n\nI don’t want to leave without saying that Peter Thiel is an evil, racist, greedy bastard who would have every child skinned alive if profit demanded it. He’s one of these liars that goes on and on about “transhumanism” to shill his own fucking products, and talks about “the risks of AI” specifically to make it sound like his products are on this one-way track to being all-powerful. Also he called fucking Greta Thurnberg the antichrist. He is not to be taken seriously. If you see something he’s said in the future, please do us all a favor and ignore him.",

He’s an accelerationist. He wants the world to burn. And he’s spending billions to make that happen. He is actively trying to encourage the collapse of civilization to institute “techno feudalism” where billionaires like him will control despotic nation states. Seriously. Those are his beliefs. He also literally gets blood infusions from a harem of healthy teenage boys as part of some sort of life-extension program. He’s a fucking vampire. \n\nVice President JD Vance is one of his pet projects for instance: he personally bankrolled his congressional campaign to get Vance elected. And after Thiel had a private handshake meeting with Donald Trump (making who knows what promises) Vance was selected to be the VP candidate. (Vance may have even started out as one of Thiel’s “blood boys.”)\n\nThiel has frequently been compared to the antichrist before this little essay (he may just be putting this out to screw with search engine results for Thiel + Antichrist). He’s a gay man so who knows what sinister reasons he wants to cuddle up to evangelical Christianity. \n\nI don’t believe in Christianity so suffice it to say Thiel is a horrible, sadistic, sociopathic, twisted, pathetic human monster who makes the world worse by continuing to live.

The 3rd season, the genre just became \"Star Wars Show.\"\n\nSkeleton Crew was a pirate focused Amblin movie style show. \n\nThe Bad Batch was The A-Team meets 3 Men and a Baby in a political war thriller.\n\nI think why the Clone Wars is so beloved is the show as a whole wasn't 1 genre. But each arc was a different genre with a war as the backdrop. So there is something for everyone.\n\nMany people didnt like the Acolyte. That was rather genreless. It was marketed as a whodunnit, but us and the characters in the show knew who the killer was immediately.  I think if there were multiple viable options to be The Stranger and there was a big reveal in the penultimate episode with the audience and the characters trying to figure out who it was, the show would have been received better. Especially with the show having the message, don't believe everything you see. \n\nSame goes for Obi-Wan Kenobi and Book of Boba Fett. They felt like they didnt know what genre they wanted to be. Supposedly Book of Boba Fett was a crime/mob show, but the mob boss is against crime? Kenobi could have been a 80s/90s action movie throwback with hin trying to rescue Leia. He was the guy who jumped down infront of General Grievous with the \"Hello there\" line. It could have been a Western about Kenobi trying to defend Tattooine from Inquisitors without being outed as a Jedi. It could have been a straight family drama about a man trying to turn his \"brother\" back from being evil. Instead it was nothing. \n\nI just think moving forward, every SW show and movie should have a clear and defined genre. \n",

They’re beautifully shot, the effects are great and the acting is tremendous but the stories are a mess. The spin-offs had a chance to be their own thing. Rogue One for instance is tremendous. However, the ST had everything but a coherent story and two filmmakers in the span of three films with their own agendas, which just doomed things. I stand by the belief that they are three decent stand alone films but not a trilogy.",

I *LOVE* Andor and think it’s among the best Star Wars we have ever received (period!), but what I love about this franchise is how diverse it can be. I love the high fantasy elements of the Skywalker Saga movies or Ahsoka, as well as the lighthearted adventure take inspired by Goonies that we got with Skeleton Crew. I love the Western we got in The Mandalorian, but also the super serious political thriller that is Andor. Star Wars can offer us an immense variety and we shouldn’t lose focus of that only because Andor worked really well.\n\nRather, we should think about *why* Andor worked so well: Tony Gilroy and his team had a story they wanted to tell - a story about the rise of fascism, about what drives people to abuse their power for personal gains and the atrocities they are willing to commit for the sake of said power, but also about those who are fed up with this corruption and how resistance comes about. This is a story that would have worked perfectly without the Star Wars IP in something like a historical drama, it just *happens* to take place within the galaxy far, far away. And that’s the point: before they started, they had a story and interesting characters, the Star Wars IP just provided the setting. They also placed a heavy emphasis on great cinematography, real locations and massive physical sets, while avoiding the cost-cutting volume as much as possible. THESE are the lessons that Lucasfilm and fans alike should take away from this. It’s not so much about the themes and the dark tone of Andor and more so about good writing and meticulous attention to detail. The show felt really well-made, which is something I can’t say about most of the other Star Wars shows. For instance, while I still enjoy the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, it often looked very cheap and its writing was all over the place to the extent where I firmly believe that it was simply rushed out the door in order to quickly provide content for Disney+.",

One of the kids that killed someone on his 4th time stealing a car just got his case dismissed.  So that'll be great when he steals a car again and kills someone else and suffers no consequences. As long as democrats keep appointing piece of shit judges that just let people go with 0 repercussions I will always be on the fence about where to vote.  I want legal weed, I want abortion rights full stop, but I think putting people in prison for violent crime and property crime is important too.  Why the fuck do I have to choose between those two?

Also appreciate the opportunity to engage. \n\nIf I understand correctly, you think that \"personally pro life but let people do what they want/government, butt out\" and \"pro choice\" should stay in different camps so that it's easier to rebut fully \"pro life\" stances?\n\nLet me know if that's incorrect. I grew up in that weird 'middle world' where I was personally pro life but felt government shouldn't impose religious restrictions on the general population... but would have been shunned by family, church, etc if I took the mantle of \"pro choice\", because \"pro choice\" = \"anti Christian\"/\"pro-abortion\". \n\nThere's validity to running \"underground\" in those ultra conservative circles and bringing up the \"I'm pro life, I just think that the gov't shouldn't be forcing its way on other people, reminds me of...\" and insert scripture reference here. Has a chance of actually having a discussion and convincing people to vote for the ability to have a choice. I do that, to a degree, with my family still. (I'm aggressively pro-choice at this point and in a church that is also aggressively so, but for the sake of not being fully written off by my family, tend to be very roundabout when expressing my beliefs instead of using hot-button words.)\n\nHowever, there's also a lot to be gained from making the \"pro choice\" movement a movement that spans multiple belief systems and parties, which it already does, but encouraging that by keeping the \"I wouldn't personally, but you need to let everyone make that choice\" crowd. \n\nWhy is that? People saying \"I'm morally and ethically opposed to abortion, and ***even I*** think that pro-choice is the right, Godly thing to be doing\" takes another huge wallop to the pro-life crowd, because it forces them to dialogue with \"their own people\" (straight up until they call the other person not a Christian etc). It chips away at the only major defense they have, the moral one, by saying \"people who share the same beliefs as you disagree that this is the correct way to be practicing them\". \n\nIn the end... easy to argue both ways, think it boils down to where the individual is, but I feel the individual should be welcomed into either group because either way, it's a net win for the pro-choice crowd. (the irony of me arguing for personal choice is not lost on me lol)",

Health experts worry it isolates the U.S. with consequences for pandemic and disease response and diplomatic relations worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. is and has historically been the largest funder of the global health agency headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. WHO, part of the United Nations, is tasked with preparing for and fighting health emergencies. The U.S. has strongly influenced the agency since its founding after World War II.\n\nTrump criticized WHO for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as his administration faced [scrutiny for being slow to respond to the crisis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/15/trump-facing-criticism-covid-fight-he-delays-biden-transition/6302909002/). In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, [he began the process of pulling out from WHO](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/07/covid-19-trump-officially-withdraws-us-world-health-organization/5391909002/). \n\nDespite his promise, he failed to do so under U.S. law governing the timeline for withdrawal and funding obligations to the agency. Former [President Joe Biden reversed Trump’s decision](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/22/scientists-applaud-biden-decision-rejoin-world-health-organization/4243377001/) after taking office and restored funding to WHO.\n\nTrump’s executive order — on the first day of his second term rather than the last year of his first presidency — allows him to actually carry out his decision.\n\nThe order said the U.S. was withdrawing \"due to the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\" It also cited the \"payments \"unfairly onerous payments\" the U.S. has made to support the organization.\n\nDuring the Biden administration the U.S. continued its role as the largest funder of the agency, which has a budget of $6.8 billion in the current fiscal year. Nearly a fifth of WHO’s budget in 2023 came from the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. has been a part of WHO since 1948, the same year the organization launched, and the departure would make the nation the only major power that’s not a member of the 194-country body.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the agency will do everything to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration to continue to strengthen for global health security, Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, said in an email. The partnership between WHO and the U.S. has \"as protected and saved millions of lives in America and around the world,\" Jašarević said, citing the director-general.\n\n# ‘Grave strategic error,’ health experts say\n\nTrump’s announcement had been expected by health experts. In public and private, officials and academics raised concerns about the decision, which they said endangers the health of the nation and the world.\n\nIn December, Dr. Ashish Jha, the Biden White House’s former COVID-19 response coordinator, called it a “catastrophic mistake” for the global community and a “terrible mistake” for the U.S.\n\n“This is going to be a grave strategic error that will make America less healthy and less safe,” Lawrence Gostin, a global public health expert and the faculty director of Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, told USA TODAY.\n\n“The withdrawal itself is going to isolate the United States,” Gostin said. “It’ll isolate us diplomatically, and it’ll isolate us in pandemic response.”\n\n# How will U.S. withdraw from WHO?\n\nTrump’s order will require arduous disentangling of American and global health institutions woven together for 75 years.\n\nWHO’s [constitution](https://apps.who.int/gb/bd/pdf_files/BD_49th-en.pdf), [drafted in New York](https://www.who.int/about/history), doesn’t have a clear exit method for member states. A [joint resolution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decad052.asp) by Congress in 1948 outlined that the U.S. can withdraw with one year's notice. This is contingent, however, on ensuring that its financial obligations to WHO “shall be met in full for the organization’s current fiscal year.”\n\nThe U.S. is the only member state to have made such an exit strategy, Jašarević, of WHO, said. The former Soviet Union withdrew from WHO in 1949 during Cold War tensions, though returned years later.\n\nQuestions remain on how the U.S., and the rest of the world, will interact and respond to health emergencies in the future.\n\nThe U.S. leaving WHO would grievously weaken the global health agency from responding to outbreaks, conduct surveillance and cooperate closely, Gostin said.\n\n“Our public health agencies would be flying blind,” he said.\n\nFor example, the Pan-American Health Organization, WHO’s regional office for the Americas, is based in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has staff at WHO and elsewhere globally. \n\nAmerican response alongside WHO has been key in fighting diseases such as polio, which has been nearly eradicated, and HIV/AIDS, under a [President George W. Bush-era program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/11/04/pepfar-hiv-program-stuck-in-congress/71219513007/) that has helped curb transmission in several countries. The Bush program is considered a success both in public health and diplomatic relations.\n\nEven more technically, information-sharing between the U.S. and WHO has been key not only to disease response, but also pharmaceutical developments to rapidly innovate and create life-saving vaccines and treatments, Gostin said.\n\nGostin now worries of other emerging diseases and pandemic threats that could leave the U.S. weaker and more vulnerable. \n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the agency will do everything to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration to continue to strengthen for global health security, Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, said in an email.

The Bush program is considered a success both in public health and diplomatic relations.\n\nEven more technically, information-sharing between the U.S. and WHO has been key not only to disease response, but also pharmaceutical developments to rapidly innovate and create life-saving vaccines and treatments, Gostin said.\n\nGostin now worries of other emerging diseases and pandemic threats that could leave the U.S. weaker and more vulnerable. \n\nThis includes a [mpox](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/11/16/clade-i-mpox-strain-cdc/76363223007/), which has killed at least a thousand people in Africa in 2024, and [bird flu circulating in the U.S.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/16/bird-flu-cdc-testing-h5n1-seasonal-flu/77744654007/) American officials assessed that bird flu has “moderate” risk of becoming a pandemic, and just one or two mutations in the avian influenza viruses that have been circulating could make it more contagious or severe in humans.\n\nGostin cited Operation Warp Speed, the accelerated COVID-19 vaccine effort, which was led by the U.S. during Trump's first administration. Then, the U.S. provided vaccines to its entire population before offering them to vulnerable people elsewhere, which struck many around the world as unfair.\n\n“In the next pandemic,” Gostin said, “we might find ourselves at the back of the line, on the outside looking in.”\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/20/trump-orders-us-exit-world-health-organization/77772989007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/20/trump-orders-us-exit-world-health-organization/77772989007/)",

He is loved.   \n>  \n>Even the rumor of his disappearance strikes a dagger to the heart of every friend of the Republic. Every one of them knows it in her heart, in his gut, in its very bones--  \n>  \n>Without Palpatine, the Republic will fall.  \n>  \n>And now confirmation comes through, and the news is worse than anyone could have imagined. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been captured by the Separatists -- and not just the Separatists.  \n>  \n>He's in the hands of General Grievous.  \n>  \n>Grievous is not like the other leaders of the Separatists. Nute Gunray is treacherous and venal, but he's Neimoidian: venality and treachery are expected, and in the Chancellor of the Trade Federation they're even virtues. Poggle the Lesser is Archduke of the weapons masters of Geonosis, where the war began: he is analytical and pitiless, but also pragmatic. Reasonable. The political heart of the Separatist Confederacy, Count Dooku, is known for his integrity, his principled stands against what he sees as corruption in the Senate. Though they believe he's wrong, many respect him for the courage of his mistaken convictions.  \n>  \n>These are hard beings. Dangerous beings. Ruthless and aggressive.  \n>  \n>General Grievous, though--  \n>  \n>Grievous is a ***monster***.  \n>  \n>The Separatist Supreme Commander is an **abomination of nature**, a fusion of flesh and droid -- and his droid parts have more compassion than what remains of his alien flesh. This half-living creature is a slaughterer of billions. Whole planets have burned at his command. He is the evil genius of the Confederacy. The architect of their atrocities.  \n>  \n>The author of their atrocities.\n\nNow that's some \\*chef's kiss\\* writing. Grievous's character design is monstrous and badass, along with the voicework done by Matthew Wood. A lot of us remember the battle at Hypori from the 2D Clone Wars, where he slaughters the Jedi Mystery Gang and it's played like a horror film. In fact, throughout most of that series has premium Grievous content, whether he's training in the Jedi Arts by Count Dooku, or leading the raid on Coruscant. \n\nMy question is, is there still room for that characterization in the current canon? His portrayal is consistent with how he is in Episode 3, but not necessarily with all the EU stuff I listed above. He oscillates between a truly deadly Jedi hunter and a coward in the 3D Clone Wars animated series. I would love to see more new Clone Wars content featuring many of those characters like Cad Bane, Mace Windu, etc., but maybe none moreso than General Grievous himself.",

In TFA, Hux was basically Kylo’s rival from within the FO. Hux had so much favor with Snoke that even Kylo dare not lay a finger on him. Given Kylo’s insane temperament and amount of power, that’s *serious.* And for the viewer, it’s a fun dynamic to see. Hux was cold, calculating, and vicious. He personally ordered a *massive* war crime that killed trillions of people, and when Starkiller began collapsing, Snoke made it clear that he wanted Hux off the base safely.\n\nNow, on to episode 8... *que Benny Hill theme* Hux is the butt end of “yo momma” jokes, and the victim of prank phone calls from Poe. He has no idea how to command the FO fleet and relies upon his generals to do it for him. He gets tossed around by Kylo like a rag doll. Yo, Rian Johnson, I’m no big fancy Hollywood executive, but making your antagonist double as the *comedic relief* is a *baaaad* idea. It totally retcons Hux’s character and deflates all tension and drama derived from the war in your movie called “Star Wars.”",

Who knows if Obi-Wan would have been able to beat him? Maybe such a power Greivous would have shifted the balance of power among the Septatists from Dooku to Greivous?

To do this you need competent people on both sides, the galaxy has to be pushed to the edge and the Jedi need to be threatened.\n\nOld Grievous did all of that, he wasn't some joke because Palpatine is competent enough to deal with people that aren't just idiots. He was exactly what the quote from the book said a monster to the wider galaxy and a threat because if he's a joke like TCW makes him his existence would literally be at risk everytime he comes up against a jedi. Instead you build someone who is capable of taking down all but the very best.\n\nThe idea Palpatine wouldnt allow there to be a Grievous that might defeat his future apprentice missed the point of the sith. It's trial by fire if he had a potential apprentice that Grievous could beat then they wouldnt be that great to begin with all sith are put in situations they can die from and the idea is always \"if you dont make it you weren't worth it anyway.\"\n\nDooku is also still above Grievous but this also goes into of TCW fails with that character to who used to be comparable to Yoda and Mace in legends(with Lucas actually saying in AotC in the force Dooku is equal to Yoda) so it was a big deal when Anakin beat him. Taking him down to someone Vos beats and is outsmarted by pirates is another terrible aspects of TCW because it mishandled almost all the villains and the separatists as a whole. They just lose. Every arc basically ends in a loss the way the show makes it seem is the Republic just wins basically every time rather than what the MMP showed the war to be an extreme back and forth that had competent people on both sides.",

When you need an outside guide to determine a linear watch through of a television serious, yeah, that sucks. And I watched Clone Wars as it came out on Cartoon Network and the constant back and forth of the first two and half seasons in time was annoying. It's easy to loose the threads and connectivity of certain arcs when some are literally just one episode in one later season that is actually the first episode of an arc starting with an episode from a previous season. That's my problem with The Clone Wars, especially when friends want to get into it because they have to follow a labyrinth to experience it properly.\n\nAs for all the other complaints...they clearly didn't see the behind the scenes videos with Dave Filoni which basically all amounted to him speaking with George Lucas himself for a great deal of The Clone Wars' production. This Including the Witches, Darth Maul's Return, the Mortis Arc. All of that. Like Everything Filoni did with Lucas approval. They even damn Lucas for the Maul resurrection in this post when they are trying to blame it all Filloni and uh, Lucasfilm as a whole. This has nothing to do with Disney so isn't the usual diatribe about Kennedy and Woke nonsense it's supposedly like the peak of Star Wars content under the eyes of the genius George Lucas, but apparently that isn't good enough for this person for reasons they poorly explain if at all in their so called critique. Honestly I made a better point about what I disliked about the series more articulately with one point while still being able to say I'm a fan of The Clone Wars. I Just admit it's hard to recommend to others as it's a chore to actually watch properly in order and watching it as it was released was confusing. Everything else this person says is just nonsensical complaints, without any substance and due to most of it relating to the Clone Wars' original run he clearly didn't realize that George Lucas was all over the project with Dave Filoni acting as George's practical protege. They clearly don't have an idea of what they want and just want to blame what didn't like on someone.  \n\n\nDidn't want to reply but felt I need to for once seeing as for all they said in their discussion of flaws, nothing a value was by this individual at all.",

And the arrangement of the stories. I get the desire to see everything as it happens chronologically, and there would certainly be a tonal whiplash from watching the Malevolence Arc and then skipping straight to something complete different with the Umbara arc, but even then, that can be seen as a juxtaposition of the lighter, more adventure-esque stories with the more serious, \"hard ships of war\".\n\nBasically, I don't think there's really a wrong way to watch the clone wars that isn't just like, backwards or skipping through arcs.

            "text": "**Full Disclosure :-** I have been permanently banned by both our Country sub and my home city sub as I have a habit (which you will see shortly) of speaking the inconvenient Truth.\n\nNow let’s get down to main subject matter of this post.\n\n**Prologue :**\nAs someone whose family has been resident of Kolkata for over 150 years and our residential house was itself built in 1936 and my grandfather was almost killed during the Great Calcutta Killings of 1946 when he went to collect his pension from G.P.O. in central Calcutta. He was hospitalised with a grievous head injury but thankfully recovered. So the prospective I am about to put now is a long term one and not based on any one particular event.\n\n\n**My Prospective :-**\nLet’s start with some pure statistics :-\n\nMuslim Population percentage as per census data were as follows :-\n\n1) Post partition 1951 census = 16% \nNow why even after the bloody partition, there were still 16% Muslims and not a full population exchange like Punjab (which also was a border state like us and went through similar bloody partition) is anybody’s guess.  I leave it to the wisdom of our father of the nation and Nehru kaka.\n\n2) Last official census of 2011 = 27%\n\n3) Projected percentage in 2025 = 33% (Official projected demographics by census statisticians and generally accepted by all parties)\n\n4) Right Wing projections of 2025 = 40%\nWhy our central government still not conducting an official census survey even after covid had died down and we are late by 4 years from the designated census timeline is anybody’s guess.\n\n\nNow this demographic change was not all of a sudden as you can see from the statistics it was a gradual process which accelerated in the last 10-15 years. The primary factors were as follows :-\n\n1) Hindu Bengalis has some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. It’s comparable to fertility rates of some of the richer western countries who are facing similar demographic challenges. The only problem is our fertility rate has dropped to developed country levels without we getting as rich as those developed countries. This brings a myriad of problems as we will see.\n\n2) Illegal immigration from neighbouring country specially in the North of the state. Our state government is in cahoots with these illegals getting Voter ids and aadhaar cards. And BSF under central government is corruption riddled enough to allow it happen in exchange of cash from ring leaders of illegal crossings.\n\n\nThe demographic change will accelerate as soon as the Muslim population reaches a critical mass which is generally 25%-30%. This is true all across the world, so nothing specific to India or West Bengal. Just look at Lebanon. West Bengal reached that threshold around 2 decades back and since then the demographic change has accelerated.\n\nNow look at history of any part of the world and you will find once the Muslim population reaches majority it’s end game for non-Muslims living there. It’s true at a housing society level, locality level, village level, district level, city level, state level and of course country level. West Bengal as a state will reach this point of No Return within the next 2 decades I.e. within 2047.\n\n**Now What to do ?**\n\n**Political / Administrative Level :**\n\nWest Bengal needs to be broken down to at-least 3 smaller states of 3-4 Crore population each. It has become too big a state (population wise) to rule from Kolkata and the entire state has only one commercial centre I.e. Kolkata and all youth flock to Kolkata for employment. Also the division into 3 sates will make sure Muslim population is  distributed across the 3 states. It will also give rise to 2 more capital cities, which will in turn give rise to 2 more economic centers which this state badly needs. All my fellow Bengalis who cry “Banga Vanga” at the drop of a hat, respectfully STFU. You are being killed, your daughters are being raped and you are sticking to a 1905 concept which itself ceases to be a point when we partitioned it ourselves in 1947. And breaking current West Bengal into 3 states will not affect you in your day to day life and you still will be able to go your chosen places in current West Bengal with ease just like you go to Orissa or Jahrkand. Added bonus will be those two states will also have Bengali as the main language, so no change for you. \n\n**Individual / Personal level :**\n\nThis is what I have been doing at the individual level since the last 1 decade I.e. since I realised what the long term outlook is for Kolkata / West Bengal. \nMove all your networth into Financial instruments (Mutual Funds, stocks, bonds, FDs, FCR etc) and try not to have any significant portion of your Net worth in any immovable property / assets in West Bengal. If push comes to shove and you have to leave your home overnight and not to return ever again like our eastern Hindu Bengalis 78 years ago or like our Kashmiri Pandits 35 years ago, then at-least you will get to keep most of your Networth and don’t have to start from scratch. Your 1.5 Crore South Kolkata flat will be worth ZERO and you will have no access to it.\n\n**And this time there is No Gopal Patha to save your sorry ass.** \n\n**IF YOU DON’T LEARN FROM HISTORY, HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF.**\n",

Some of these are less common so I thought it would be interesting to post them.\n\nThere are many problems with it, but here are those on top of my head:\n\n— Disjointed storytelling. Most arc are independent of each other or weakly linked\n\n— Lack of nuance and where it is present it’s kinda blunted.\n\n— Many arc have no impact. Example: clone funding arc with Padme. It was badly written, but even then, there is no impact after of defeating the bill. It would seem that with lower funding on clones will have huge impact on the war, political balance, public perception of Padme etc. One could write a lot into this, something, anything.  But there is nothing. Abysmal. And this negligence happens almost all the time. Mortis arc too.\n\n— Le Force Dudes (Mortis arc) and the idiotic contradictory balance of the force. Lucas should have fired his entire team here (Alas)\n\n— Ahsoka. She is a cool idea really, Obiwan feeding Anakin his own medicine, but oh well we all know what happened. Also she doesn’t “grow” as a character, more rewritten every time Filoni needed to.\n\n— Absolutely atrocious, ugly like plague Jedi terror bombing and the order kicking Ahsoka out. This is morbidly stupid. Filoni needed Jedi order to be bad so he shits out this cancer of an arc.\n\n— War is not explained. War is not really depicted. It’s just random battles. There is no explanation or over all picture of the wars. Very disappointing. On screen the good guys win, but off screen the bad guys loose.\n\n— General Grievous. I pity him so much. He didn’t deserve this. I don’t know why the writers hate him.\n\n—Darth Maul resurrection. Damn you, Lucas!\n\n— Witches magic voodoo crap. Wtf?\n\n— Political system not explained. To be fair, they did dig into it, but lack in both depth and breadth. Very disappointing.\n\nThat is everyone I could remember so far. Throw me your points\n\nEdit:  a lot of things that people criticize Disney for today, was first done here by Finoli. Character assassinantions, chasing the ends, Mary Sue, bs retcons, squandered EU/legends. In retrospect, TCW was a harbinger of doom for Star Wars.",

He's characterized as a generic quippy jedi general who never develops but happens to have a few OMG HE'S ACTUALLY EVIL moments sprinkled into the story but then immediately skipped over for the sake of the next inconsequential story arc.\n\nThe idea of Anakin getting a padawan is frankly a huge contrivance too. You're telling me the jedi councilors who never trusted Anakin would give him, an arrogant immature superpowered hothead, a padawan to train in the middle of a galactic war while he's bouncing between battlefields trying to lead clone armies? I'm sorry but no matter what justification you try to push for it, it'll always be contrived.\n\nThere's a few good episodes in there and there are definitely much worse SW shows but I'm not a huge fan of it either. It feels too much like some superfans became writers and wanted to play with their favorite toys in all kinds of prequel scenarios, and too little like bridging the gap between episodes II and III. Arcs like Mortis reek of that mindset, it never should've happened.",

The whole thing is basically just glorified fanfiction written by a fanboy centered completely around his mary sue OC, which literally just describes Filoni and everything he's made ever since. \n\nI didn't used to hate Ahsoka but upon my re-watch and re-analysis she really has no business existing for more than an episode arc or two, and I've come to hate her more over the years as Filioni makes the entirety of Star Wars centered completely around her. \n\nDon't get me started on the EU retcons either. The CWMMP was a vastly superior telling of the Clone Wars, Filoni essentially Thanos-snapped over half of that material out of existence. When Disney de-canonized the EU they should have just removed TCW from Legends and have it exclusively exist in Disney Canon but it's original run is left in Legends as an overgrown tumor. In fact later EU authors were forced to retroactively make lore revisions (such as Ableloth's origins) just to make TCW somewhat make sense.\n\nFiloni was Disney SW before Disney bought the IP, writing glorified fanfiction warping the established canon to fit his mary sue's needs.\n\nI also really hate the savior complex Filoni has and how people say TCW \"saved\" the prequels. The people who say TCW \"saved\" the prequels don't understand the prequels, I firmly am in the camp that the prequels were actually good movies and TCW *harms* the prequels more than anything. The CWMMP feels like it belongs with the prequels way more than TCW does (especially with a more realistic trajectory for Anakin's character based on how George wrote him).\n\nI get the feeling people only jack off TCW and Filoni because he's better than JJ Abrams or Rian Johnson, but that bar of standard isn't exactly high. If you ask me the ones who've shown they are best fits for Star Wars post-Lucas are Edwards and Gilroy, but the Mouse doesn't like them much I guess.\n\nBut anyways, the only real \"essential\" viewing from TCW that I would ever recommend to people would be the Yoda arc from Season 6 since Lucas wrote that and it goes inside Lucas' head on how the Force works, but other than that just no.",

We’re doing our own thing.” Groups that derive from the light, dark and in between using their side of the Force in non traditional ways. The important thing for writing is for these groups to keep to themselves to avoid to big of an impact on the Galaxy and it’s conflicts. This usually involves adding a lot of cultural details which adds to the worldbuilding in a great way. As always the key is good writing.

They’re utterly useless and always follow a heavier/darker arc to give levity. Later seasons get more mature, but only so much so given inherent limitations on a “kids” animated show. I think in the end the balance was struck well given the limitations of the show.

The clone wars has a different characterization of Anakin that’s about all you got right there. \n\nI think the characterization matches pretty closely with how he is presented in the first couple minutes of revenge of the Sith, which is the only time Anakin feels like a real enjoyable character or a hero. The clone wars does bridge the gap and almost clarifies his defining character flaw. His flaw is his inability to let go. He is never able to accept that sometimes he can’t save everyone. We see him throughout the clone show as a hero and a courageous Jedi knight, which feels a lot closer to the way Obi-Wan described him in a new Hope, and every time they present his secretly evil side it is always connected to his inability to accept loss. He goes out of his way to try and save his friends and the people he cares about no matter the cost. That can easily be seen as a heroic trait, but we can also see the way it is going to lead him down a dark path. Revenge of the Sith feels sort of confused about why Anakin is going to switch sides since it’s both that he feels betrayed by the Jedi order and that they’ve undercut him, and that he wants to save Padme. But with the context of the clone wars, it seems to clarify that the defining flaw that brought him to the dark side is his inability to accept loss and pain and his determination to save everyone, especially those that he loves. And that is present in the movies, but at the expense of him being an actual hero. The clone wars find a nice way to balance those two attributes and makes his defining character flaw. What makes him a hero, and what brings him to the Dark side.\n\nAlso, yeah, it is a bit contrived that he got a padawan on but I think it serves the story and it’s a children’s show so I’m willing to let it slide since it makes for a better story even if it’s a bit silly.\n\nI’m sure all of that came off a little hostile, so I wanna pull back a little bit and say I respect your opinion and you don’t have to like it. You are more than welcome to prefer the prequels. I find Anakin in the prequels to be whiny and unlikable. He sounds nothing like the hero Obi-Wan describes in a new hope , the clone war Anakin does.

Beyond that, Clone Wars Anakin was a true precursor to Vader in a way that a movie where Anakin is in the middle of a sleep deprived mental breakdown/genocidal rampage couldn't give us. He wasn't at his best in Revenge of the Sith from the moment he had his first nightmare. That doesn't mean that he otherwise wouldn't have been very similar to Clone Wars Anakin.\n\nThe real issue was how *Attack of the Clones Anakin* was ever supposed to believably get through three and a half years after what he just did without going off like a loose canon way before ROTS and be the person who transitions into Vader unless they did some serious gymnastics. They had to rein him in somehow and give any credence to Obi-wan's description of him to Luke. \n\nFor all the issues the Ahsoka series has, Hayden's seamless bridging of the three portrayals of Anakin (counting AotC and RotS Anakin separately) shows how conceivable they were as the same character imo.",

It's one of those things you just accept because expecting them to freeze the lore permanently would be silly. \n\nAnd there are a lot of ways you could retcon Ahsoka into canon, and TCW did handle that in a decent way.\n\nMy personal issue with TCW is that it should have closed with a final season of Anakin coming to terms with losing his padawan the way he did and set up the anger/hate he developed for the Council from this to lead into Episode 3.\n\nWithout that closure focused on Anakin - ya know, the central character to the OG and prequel trilogies - TCW's contribution to the lore comes off as weaker.",

The Age of Rebellion is still upon us, headlined by the return of Scarif in Supremacy, Co-Op and Instant Action.\n\nThe update releases on April 29 and we’ve got a lot to talk about, so let’s dive in with the details. \n\n[Age of Rebellion Supremacy & Instant Action](https://i.redd.it/bbu7fip9rkv41.gif)\n\nThe list of Supremacy planets for the Age of Rebellion is spearheaded by the return of Scarif, a planet we know you’re incredibly excited to venture back to. Joining Scarif will also be a series of iconic Age of Rebellion locations; Hoth, Death Star II, Tatooine, and Yavin 4.\n\nEach of these locations will also be arriving into Instant Action, making the Age of Rebellion Supremacy experience available offline as well as online. \n\n[Co-Op Updates](https://i.redd.it/w56s6kkcrkv41.gif)\n\nWe continue to see great feedback around Co-Op and it’s been wonderful watching the reactions, gameplay clips and reading your comments on the last update, which brought the game mode into the Age of Rebellion.\n\nFollowing on from that theme we’re adding Scarif to the list of available Age of Rebellion locations, and it will join all the existing locations in the map rotation.\n\nBack in January, we released both the MC85 Star Cruiser and Resurgent-Class Star Destroyer as part of the Supremacy setup for the Age of Resistance. The feedback we received on both of these Capital Ships was incredibly positive. As a result of this, we’ve made the decision to bring them to Co-Op as standalone locations.\n\nYou’ll find both the MC85 Star Cruiser and the Resurgent-Class Star Destroyer within the Age of Resistance map rotation.\n\nWith this update, we’ll be renaming Co-Op to Co-Op Missions. \n\n[Instant Action Missions](https://i.redd.it/lihibzifrkv41.gif)\n\nWith the positivity and reception surrounding Instant Action we’ve decided to expand it further, bringing a new option to offline play.\n\nInstant Action Missions are based around the Co-Op multiplayer experience, allowing you to play with 3 friendly AI allies and take on an enemy team made up of AI using our existing Co-Op Missions.\n\nFaction select will be possible, enabling both attack and defend gameplay options and the mode will be supported by every Co-Op location we have within the game, across all 3 eras. \n\n[Crait Heroes Vs. Villains](https://i.redd.it/sgdamj5irkv41.gif)\n\nHeroes Vs. Villains will be receiving a new planet in April, as the battle between dark and light reaches the salty mineral planet of Crait. This is one of our most requested HvV locations to date so it’s really exciting to be bringing it to the game mode.\n\nThe combat area will be focused inside the main hangar, with the blast doors open, letting in the sunset outside. \n\n[Trooper Appearances](https://i.redd.it/fsrqih3mrkv41.gif)\n\nWhen we announced that you would be returning to Scarif, one of the more prominent requests that we started to see surrounded the Shoretrooper appearances.\n\nWithin this update, we are pleased to confirm that troopers will have new appearances based on the Shoretrooper setup. Members of the Empire will have their Shoretrooper appearances, while the Rebellion will have access to their Pathfinder variants. \n\n[Hero Appearances](https://i.redd.it/gb7ijohorkv41.gif)\n\nWe know that many of you have been requesting new appearances for heroes (and villains) in the game, which is why we’ll be rounding out April with a selection of brand new ones.\n\nDarth Maul has been a hero who, in terms of new appearance requests, has consistently been one of the most prominent, which is why we’re incredibly excited to announce that he will have an appearance based on Star Wars Rebels available to him, complete with robotic legs. \n\n[Old Master Maul](https://i.redd.it/i7shj7rrrkv41.gif)\n\nBack in December, we brought three Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker™ appearances to the game, for Rey, Kylo Ren, and Finn. We’ve got two more on the way, and if you haven’t seen Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker™ yet, look away now! \n\n[Rey Skywalker](https://i.redd.it/dodwjm0urkv41.gif)\n\nThe first of these new appearances belong to Emperor Palpatine, and will be focused around his red robes. The second Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker appearance is based on Rey with her hood down, and with her new yellow lightsaber. We’re looking forward to bringing both of these frequently requested appearances to the game in April.  \n \n\n[Sith Eternal Palpatine](https://i.redd.it/9gx2xr0wrkv41.gif)\n\nWe also have a new appearance arriving for the dark side arriving in this month’s update, Kylo Ren with his hood up. \n\n[Damage Increase Messaging](https://preview.redd.it/1z7vg1fyrkv41.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=906d2bba6b7c2d8d098a8e6c62982f76471a449c)\n\nWe are adding in-game messaging for Damage Increase, and how it relates to damage decrease.\n\nYou can suffer a damage increase from two sources today: BB-8's Resistance Backing ability, and Dooku's Expose Weakness ability. Having a Damage Increase on yourself means that you take more than normal damage from any damage source.\n\nDamage Increase is messaged in-game in the same three elements as Damage Decrease:\n\nAbove Head: When looking at a friend or enemy, left of their health bar, an icon denoting damage increase will be shown for the duration of the effect\n\n* This icon is always red when looking at an enemy\n* You will only ever see the increase OR the decrease icon in this placement\n\nHit Indicator: When dealing damage to an enemy, the damage increase icon will animate out from your crosshair to denote that you dealt more than normal damage\n\n* This animation is always red\n* You will only ever see the increase OR the decrease animation\n\nPlayer Health: When looking at your own health bar at the bottom of your screen, icons will be shown to the left of your health number for the duration of any damage increase and/or damage decrease\n\n* You will see both the increase AND the decrease icon in this placement if you are affected by both simultaneously\n* The colors of these icons in this placement change to show the net effect:\n* You take more damage: Increase icon is red / Decrease icon is grey\n* You take less damage: Increase icon is grey / Decrease icon is yellow\n\n[Explosion Damage Reduction Redesign](https://preview.redd.it/nyslmhv1skv41.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=f513228d5925ca59f87eca46104786faba9b0f79)\n\nWe are removing the two cases in the game that would give you explosion damage reduction. This is done to ensure that our damage increase/decrease messaging is robust in all cases. We are also hoping that the redesign detailed below of the Bodyguard Star Card (which is largely unused by all Trooper classes) will make it more viable to bring into battle.\n\nThe BODYGUARD Star Card keeps its name but has a new description to reflect the new design. The gameplay effect changes to:\n\n* When at Critical Health (below 30%), you gain X% overall damage reduction\n* The amount of damage reduction scales with Star Card Rarity\n\nThe Critical Health Level is already messaged in-game by an audio filter and a red vignette, letting you know that you are in grave danger. The new design of the Bodyguard Star Card is meant to give you an increased chance of survival while in this state in certain situations.\n\nThe new gameplay effect means that some low/mid damage weapons will require 1 additional shot to kill an enemy that has Bodyguard equipped. As an example, it will take 7 instead of 6 body shots to kill a non-Heavy, and 8 instead of 7 body shots to kill a Heavy with Bodyguard equipped. The number of headshots from a default blaster to kill a non-Heavy and Heavy are unchanged.\n\nHigh damage weapons such as sniper rifles are largely unaffected as well. You can still kill a Trooper that has Bodyguard equipped with 1 headshot or 2 body shots with the NT-242 sniper rifle.\n\nAll examples above are made from the Epic Rarity of the Star Card, which is where the biggest effect kicks in. This damage reduction is only applied while below 30% health and is immediately removed when you go above that. For non-Heavy Troopers, this state is entered when below 45 health. For Heavy Troopers, the threshold is below 60 health.  \nFrom everyone on the Star Wars Battlefront II team, we thank you. Thank you for being a part of everything we’ve done, and for being the best community we could have asked for.\n\n***May the Force be with you. Always.*** \n\n[Release Notes](https://preview.redd.it/c589m8l5skv41.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=a799b4368697ba228932db87f641e31dcfd154b7)\n\n **FEATURES**\n\n* Scarif added as a new playable map on Co-Op Missions, Supremacy, Instant Action, Heroes Vs.

Sith Eternal Palp**: *Long have I waited.....*\n\n**3. Rey Skywalker**: I actually can't believe they did this. I was sure Lucasfilm would turn it down, but the crazy sons of bitches actually did it! I love the yellow saber, it's absolute glorious. Only problem is...\n\n**4. Hooded Rey**: Kind of weird that they made this a separate skin with the Skywalker Saber. Maybe its because she had the hood up on Ahch-To.\n\n**5. Rebels Maul**: Yessss! This will be my go-to Maul skin always because of the robot legs. It'll feel so immersive in Clone Wars battles.\n\n**6. Rebel Pathfinder**: cool skin. I hope it turns white on Hoth\n\n**7. Shoretroopers**: Okay, I knew this skin was coming. I was really hoping for literally any other Imperial skin, but we got this one. Makes sense considering Scarif and the large amount of people that wanted it, I'm just not ready to see them on Hoth.......\n\nI'm just one person though. I'd love to hear other people's opinions on the announced skins!",

Regardless you guys have done a wonderful job bringing this game to the place it is now from where it was at launch and I hope to continue to be impressed with your work. Everyone on the dev team should be incredibly proud of the work they have managed to do with a game many considered to be dead by the end of the first month of release.

DICE has done an admirable job with BF2, but I'm sure Disney will have tough questions to ask about that whole shitty first 18 months the game had, and why, if they're doing so well now, why they couldn't have brought that earlier, and avoided the early missteps. There's also the fact that BF3 would be a next gen title and we don't know if that Frostbite update, if it happens, will lengthen development time.\n\nAn extreme and unlikely example that total moratorium on live service stuff may be, but based on past comments from Dennis and Ben suggesting that there is no appetite among gamers for a new Battlefront, and a heavy hint or two that Battlefront 3 wasn't at the time even in preliminary planning stages, I'd say EA is very likely to hedge its bets and let the afterglow of Battlefront II carry it through to the negotiations, with the Fallen Order series taking the lead in new release terms.",

                    "text": "So this is less of a character build and more of some ideas to consider when playing.\n\n1. Attrition: Paladins, like actual Knights, are expensive and time consuming to train and maintain so any losses are much more keenly felt. As well, as an organization they have many more moving parts you can target that can cripple them/ Target their squires, their artisans, their farmers, their merchants and all the support network a sedentary existence requires and punish them when they overextend chasing you. Making the Paladins too cautious to leave their bases is as good a victory as crushing them in the fields. As well, as a Warforged, you can ignore pesky things like sleep or sustenance, meaning you can go far longer with less than they can.\n2. Most Paladins wear heavy armor: So, turn this against them, make them regret wearing 65 pounds of steel to fight you. Swimming would be damn near impossible, and chasing after you over large periods of time favors the lighter armored side. Fight in areas like swamps and mountainous/hilly areas to further press the advantage, bonus points for home town advantage. Otherwise, strike in the early morning or late at night when the paladins are no longer wearing heavy armor. Or, if the DM is particularly keen on realism, attack them on the march where the Paladins are less likely to be wearing armor. Armor is also expensive, and every suit lost is 1500 gold, 65 pounds and weeks of work lost.\n3. Fight Dirty: Honor and pride is for those with the strength to ignore the weaknesses it gives them, but they can also be bought with results. Paladins are bound and empowered by their oaths, make them break them. Force them to choose between pursuing you or helping those they've sworn to defend. Raid a village and leave it's inhabitants alive but gravely injured to force them to use their spell slots and lay on hands to heal them. Spread poison and disease to do the same, especially since they don't affect you as a warforged. Use feints and misdirection to split a greater force into smaller, more manageable ones, and never offer a head to head clash you are not 100% sure you can't win. Use traps, the environment, explosives, fire anything to give you an advantage. A paladin in a 10 foot pit with punji spikes is one more you don't have to deal with immediately, another pushed into a raging river will most likely drown before they can doff their armor. Also don't be too proud to run, killing one man is easier than a hundred after all. Maybe if you sneak into a camp, cause a stampede with their own warhorses, set fire to their food supplies, anything is fair game.\n4. Speaking of Fire: Fire is your best friend, because you know being a Warforged means you can destroy massive swathes of agriculture and forests with no real detriment to you. Causing a massive famine could lead to a peasant revolt against the paladins, burning down forests denies wood for weapons, tools and fuel. Even better, if there are elves living in any nearby forests, put on their armor and fly their banners to perform a false flag attack and burn down their forest to spark a war between the elves and the paladins.\n\nTL:DR life gets a lot easier for a martial character if you're willing to commit war crimes.",

An Assassin 3 dip on a surprise round get a crit on all hits. Alternatively, an advantage focused build can use Eleven Accuracy to crit-fish, especially as a Champion Fighter.\n\n+ Another Fighter choice is the Rune Knight. This also allows for strong defensive & offensive options with the runes. You can try to restrain the paladins, give them disadvantage as a reaction, or flat out force a re-roll. If there are multiple Paladins, you can even redirect attacks so they Smite eachother.\n\n+ a Barbian-Rogue combination can be very durable and be the best grappler/Strenght-checker there is. High durability is always great to have and the Paladin's biggest weakness is skill checks.\n\nBut overall I agree: Not using magic against magic-users is a tough match-up.",

He sees them as doing horible things akin to the \"evil\" they fight, but lie to the public and claim honor therefor making them worse. It wouldnt matter if what soured him was part of a currupt system or an individual. Love turned to fear and fear into anger and you know the rest. \n\nI like the idea of a chaotic good guy burning the \"false followers\" with an outpouring of radient energy like a zellot. He refuses to use magic, but has natural overflowing connection due to their heritage using it to show that they are truely acting on behalf of the gods burning the heretics. Maybe it is like a response he has trouble controlling and durring battle it overflows as anger and wrath erupt as holy energy. \n\nA bit of barb (storm for extra aura) could be fun if you want to be less composed. \n\nI could even see if you go dex based a few levels in monk for  flury of blows and something like open hand's knock prone. (Or kensi for a saber blaster combo).  Grappling is str based, so that is not likely, but stuns are a nice way to target saves which is a good way to take down the tanky palis so it could be better than first thought of. I likly wouldnt go to 5 for stunning strikes since BM is just too good to deviate from for that long, but wanted to mention an alternative path. \n\nI would mostly stick to bm grappling though. Maybe picking up the mage slayer feat too if you roll good on stats and dont need each asi.

                    "text": "They are strong, I agree, but not \"on a level no other class is\". The aura of protection, for example, it helps them make saves, often for half damage. But bear barbs get half damage on nearly everything. And monks get proficiency in every save (yes that's later on, but it takes some ASIs to get your cha up there). And warlocks can get eldritch smite. Paladin features are similar to many other powerful features. So yes they are powerful, but not beyond what other classes are capable of. \n\nAnd I wouldnt say \"they can fill every conceivable role other than dex skills all at once\". They can deal tons of damage damage with smites, but that cost spells and actions that could be used to heal via cure wounds or lay on hands. They have to choose. That makes them very versatile but they cant do everything well all at once, as you claim they can. \n\nFlight/creatures that can stay out of smiting range is very frustrating to paladins. I would call that a weakness. No single d&d class is without a weakness or shortcoming. Some have multiple, some have only one or two, but they all have something. Also paladins have to maintain their oath. A DM can and should punish paladins who break their oath as the DM/the Paladin's god sees fit. This can limit roleplay choices which is frustrating, but are accepted when playing a paladin. \n\nAnd they are a popular multiclass, maybe even the most popular. I dont believe by the \"very, very large margin\" you claim, but they do get lots of love. This is not because they are broken in and of themselves, but they are very easy to make too powerful and thus break the game. They are powerful and they support the 3 other charisma caster classes and several other martial classes very well mechanically plus clerics roleplay wise. So this makes paladins prime targets for power gamers. \n\nIf you try to break the game, you can, and you can use paladins to break it, but that doesnt mean paladins themselves are broken. I wouldn't call the hammer that breaks the window broken. And I also wouldn't call the window itself broken, until someone tries breaking it.",

Every other Class has a strategy around this: All casters have long range spell options, Monks and Barbs have faster movement, monks can also use step of the wind and dex based to avoid losing initiative barbarians are only taking half damage while raging advantage on initiative rolls,\n\nRangers tend to be effective at long range combat, fighters don't have melee restrictions on their damage output (unless they took a mellee focused fighting style,  however they could take a ranged fighting style to so I going to call this one a wash) and more asis to pump into con and weapon stat to straight up go blow for blow even at range.

Many classes get something to help them overcome status effects (like a monks stillness of mind). \n\nAura of vitality is nice for a paladins action economy but you have to wait 9 levels (I think??) To get it. By then the bard could've been using it and popping 5th levels while the cleric does +100 points of healing with mass cure wounds in one round, which pales the 70ish from aura of vitality over the course of 1 minute (assuming you maintain concentration). So yeah they can do some healing and damage, but they cant do both without taking some away from the other. A slot spent to use aura of vitality, takes away from smite damage.\n\nAnd this goes beyond just action economy. Its raw ability scores too. Paladins dont have 20s in everything. They still have that 8 in dex or intelligence. Even their wisdom and cha isn't that great if they want a super high str and con. They must pick and choose what to be good at at any point in time.  \n\nCompelled duel still has a save. A wisdom save. The 2nd most common in the game. I wouldnt count on that to solve all your problems. You have to get within 30 feet of them first, which means if they have melee allies nearby to hit you if you try running towards them or some barriers between you and them, then the paladin is screwed. And your 10 seconds of scrutiny didnt quite cover the issues with flying creatures. \n\nAnd I don't believe punishing a class because they make poor RP choices is at all wrong. Many classes have RP restrictions or guidelines to help direct the player. I do try to avoid it, because it is often frustrating, but most people agree to uphold those ideals because the class presented is the sort of character they want to play. Similar to how warlocks or clerics who defy their patrons may face consequences. Or rogues who get caught stealing face punishment by law. You can play in a world of absolute chaos where nobody takes responsibility for their actions and you can do whatever they want and that may be fun, albeit a little childish. But I tend to prefer games that have a great degree of verisimilitude. Where things are reasonable and make sense and reflect real life, while still letting magic and creativity flow. That's fun to me, you can play as you wish but our differences of opinion here does not refute the fact that flying and/or ranged creatures are the bane to a paladins existance.  \n\nSo there are weaknesses to paladins. Maybe if you thought for a bit longer than 10 seconds you would realize how weak your argument is. Rather than repeating the same banal platitudes everyone brings against paladins.",

Strong, young lungs breathe in air laden with enemies turned into ashes. It is here that I thrive. I have toppled nations. I have slain kings. I have murdered legends. My name has been feared by warriors... and cursed by widows.” – General Grievous, The Clone Wars: The Dreams of General Grievous*\n\nGeneral Grievous inspired fear across the galaxy as the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems’ droid army. Always the strategist, Grievous made it a habit of escaping the clutches of the pursuing Jedi. Only after countless battles against Obi-Wan Kenobi, did Grievous’ ruthless warmongering for invading worlds and engaging Jedi in combat, come to an end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5qusrios40u11.jpg\n\n**Bringing General Grievous to Battlefront II**\n\nAs far as villains go, General Grievous, as seen in Star Wars™: Revenge of the Sith™, is one of the most complex that we’ve ever made for Star Wars™ Battlefront II.\n\nWhile he will make use of two lightsabers for his regular attacks, some of his abilities do bring his other two arms into play. Grievous coming towards you with four lightsabers swinging is a sight to behold, and one challenge that our animation team had to overcome.\n\nThere are few sights as chilling as the one of General Grievous scuttling across the floor on all six limbs. It’s not only a great way for him to escape a fight, but it’s also something that strikes a certain eerie fear into you as he approaches. You’ll get to experience this first hand with his Claw Rush ability.\n\nIt was hugely important to us that we captured the essence of General Grievous, ever the master tactician. Imposing up close, but also able to make a swift exit. We took inspiration from his appearances all across the Star Wars™ universe, most notably the movies and The Clone Wars Animated series.\n\nWho could forget the showdown between General Grievous and Obi-Wan Kenobi where the general used two rotating lightsabers? This scene from Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith would go on to serve as inspiration for his Unrelenting Advance ability and his appearance.\n\nIt would be amiss to talk about General Grievous without mentioning some of the iconic voice lines that he has available. Get ready to hear the hacking cough and, “You are a bold one,” among many other iconic lines. We went into detail on the voices of our heroes, General Grievous included, in a recent Community Transmission. Head on over here to read all about it.\n\nA challenging hero to create but one we’re incredibly excited to be welcoming into Star Wars Battlefront II. Let’s dive into his abilities, star cards, and more.\n\n**AbilitiesThrust Surge**\n\nGeneral Grievous focuses on a target in front of him and rushes to them while doing a stab motion with all 4 of his lightsabers.\n\n**Claw Rush**\n\nGeneral Grievous goes down on all 6 limbs and rushes forward, damaging and pushing away any enemies in his path.\n\n**Unrelenting Advance**\n\nGeneral Grievous spins two lightsabers over his head and can advance on his enemies. While this is active, Grievous blocks any frontal attacks and damages enemies in front of him.\n\n**Star Cards**\n\n* **Name:** Beating Heart\n* **Effects:** Increased Health Regeneration\n* **Description:** General Grievous has increased maximum health regeneration.\n\n* **Name:** Cyborg Rage\n* **Effects:** Health Regained\n* **Description:** Whenever General Grievous defeats an enemy trooper he regains 20 health. Whenever he defeats an enemy hero, he regains even more.\n\n* **Name:** Sith Trained\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage and Stamina Drain\n* **Description:** General Grievous deals extra damage with his lightsaber attacks but they drain more stamina.\n\n* **Name:** Jedi Killer\n* **Effects:** Increased Reach\n* **Description:** General Grievous can target enemies further when using Thrust Surge.\n\n* **Name:** Momentum\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage\n* **Description:** Thrust surge deals more damage to targets further than X meters.\n\n* **Name:** Cowardly Retreat\n* **Effects:** Damage Reduction\n* **Description:** General Grievous has more damage reduction while Claw Rush is active.\n\n* **Name:** Line up, Weaklings\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage\n* **Description:** After one enemy has been hit, Claw Rush deals more damage.\n\n* **Name:** Ceaseless Assault\n* **Effects:** Increased Active Time\n* **Description:** Unrelenting Advance can stay active for a longer period.\n\n* **Name:** Deadly Slashes\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage\n* **Description:** Unrelenting Advance deals more damage.\n\n**Voice Lines**There are a number of iconic voice lines that have been added for General Grievous, as well as some entirely new ones. A small selection of these are below:\n\n* “You are a bold one.”\n* “Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.”\n* “You must realise you are doomed.”\n* “I wield great power, Jedi fool.”\n* “The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here!”\n* “Make peace with the Force now, for this is your final outing.”\n* “Your screams are like music to my audio receptors.”\n* “The Kaleesh are not known for their mercy.”\n* “This will be easier than Dathomir.”\n* “A general welcomes all challengers.”\n* “(laughing) This calls for a celebration!”\n* “Now! Devastation tactics!”\n* “Do not cling to me like a dianoga! Attack!”\n* “Temper temper! You know where anger leads...”\n\nWe recently went live with a Community Transmission dedicated to Hero Voices, you can catch up on that [here](https://battlefront-forums.ea.com/discussion/121206/community-transmission-hero-voices-clone-wars).\n\n**Victory Poses**\n\n* Lines of Death\n* Jedi Hunt\n* Doom\n* Consider Yourself Crushed\n\n**Emotes**\n\n* “You are a bold one”\n* “Crush them”\n* “Surrender”\n* \"Your screams are music to my audio-receptors.\"\n\n**Milestones**\n\n* **Name:** Out of my Way\n* **Description:** Hit 30 Enemies with the Claw Rush ability\n* **Name:** Make them Suffer\n* **Description:** Defeat 30 Enemies with the Unrelenting Advance Ability\n* **Name:** Another one to the Collection\n* **Description:** Defeat 30 Enemies with the Thrust surge Ability\n* **Name:** Experienced General Grievous\n* **Description:** Earn 122,721 score as General Grievous\n* **Name:** Veteran General Grievous\n* **Description:** Earn 389,809 score as General Grievous\n\n**AppearancesJedi Hunter**The default appearance for General Grievous will be the Jedi Hunter. When you think of General Grievous, this will be the appearance that you are mostly likely to think of.\n\n**Battle Damaged**If General Grievous wasn’t feared enough, then his Battle Damaged visage will certainly invoke an additional sense of fear.\n\nThe Battle Damaged appearance will be classified as rare and cost 20,000 credits or 500 crystals.General Grievous will cost 35,000 credits and will not be purchasable for crystals. Remember to do your daily challenges and to log in each day for your daily crate reward!\n\nWe’ll be back in a few days’ time to talk about everything else that is due to arrive in the General Grievous Update on October 30.\n\n***Punch it***",
