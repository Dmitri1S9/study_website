Then the prequels lead to new breakthroughs and revolutionary CGI effects and usage. \n\n>Following the release of Return of the Jedi in 1983, George Lucas’s commitments to Star Wars, at least in film, were complete. In the intervening years — dubbed “The Dark Times” by fans — Star Wars was largely absent from the public consciousness. Lucas, for his part, spent the time raising his family and somewhat quietly shepherding the evolution of digital effects with Industrial Light & Magic, resulting in innovations like the liquid-metal T-1000 of Terminator 2 (1991) and the mind-blowingly lifelike dinosaurs of Jurassic Park (1993).\n\n>Finally, on November 1, 1994, Lucas sat down to write Episode I.\n\n>George Lucas, The Phantom Menace writer and director, Star Wars creator: Well, my decision to make Episode I was more or less driven by technology. The first three Star Wars films were designed very, very carefully to be done cheaply. We didn’t go to any big cities, we didn’t have a lot of costumes, we didn’t have a lot of extras. We didn’t have a lot of the things that cost money on a movie like that. So it was really driven by what I could afford. You have to remember, the first film was made for 13 million dollars. Today, that same film costs 300 million dollars. Even in those days, 2001 cost like 25 million dollars. And I think we had more special effects than that did.\n\n>With Episode I, I didn’t want to tell a limited story. I had to go into the politics and the bigger issues of the Republic and that sort of thing. I had to go into bigger issues. And in order to do that, I had to come up with a way of doing it, and that’s what digital technology brought me. I had Yoda but he couldn’t fight. I had cities, but I couldn’t build models that big. I had lots and lots of costumes, but I couldn’t afford to make them. So there were a lot of issues that were just practical — Episode I wasn’t doable for a long time, so I waited until we had the technology to do it.",

The visuals and music were fantastic though. PotC 5 is just really rough because of Captain  Jack Sparrow's story is stuff just happening to him and it's more luck than skill keeping him alive this time. PotC 6 as of right now is said to be a reboot since they fired Johnny Depp so there may not be closure for 4&5 if you do watch it.\n\nEdit:  PotC 4 was a pretty self contained story, but one real loose end from the after credit which wasn't addressed in 5. PotC 5 finished it's own story, but the after credit it teases doesn't really effect the closure of 5. It's just there won't be a closure for Davy Jones return.",

                    "text": "The Legolas scene of him mounting the horse [was actually because Orlando Bloom had cracked a rib and they couldn't film](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22397979/legolas-horse-two-towers-special-effects) him getting onto the horse, but had film everything else. They were gonna do some pick up shots of him getting on and they forgot to and when they remembered, Bloom was working on another film and had a beard and couldn't return to film it so they had to CGI it instead. It wasn't meant to be like that crazy, but the otherworldly abilities of being an Elf makes it lore friendly. \n\nThis is from the Official Fan Club Magazine where Peter Jackson explained how that scene came to be. \n\n>One of the scenes in The Two Towers that impressed people was the one during the Warg encounter in which Legolas is standing there one minute and then just reaches up and swings himself effortlessly onto a horse. How did you do that?\n\n>That has an interesting story behind it. Legolas is on the ground firing at the Wargs. The rest of the horsemen ride up behind him, and the idea is that he was supposed to leap into the saddle, because he spends the rest of that scene on the back of the horse. The original concept was to have Orlando turn around as the horse [comes up] up behind him with Gimli, then reach out and, in some way, hop up onto the saddle. The way I was going to shoot that was to \"cheat\" it. The shot you see in the film was a wide shot of Orlando standing there; then he does this turn where he starts to reach for the horse. That was as far as that shot was supposed to go in the film. There wasn't supposed to be any more than that.\n\n>Then we were going to do a close-up of Orlando's hand grabbing the saddle, then a close-up of Orlando's foot sticking in the stirrup, and then a close-up of Orlando landing in the saddle. It was all going to be done with two or three quick cuts and a total cheat: Suddenly, you would find him in the saddle. You wouldn't quite know how he got there, because it was going to be done tightly. On the day we started shooting that scene, we did the wide shot you see in the film with Orlando turning and reaching for the saddle. We then got him on his horse because, instead of shooting the close-ups, we were going to move on and shoot some more wide shots and come back to the close-ups. When we started shooting the wide shots of him on the horse, he fell off and cracked a rib. That put Orlando out of action. We weren't able to do any more filming with him for many days, because he had his rib bound up. The trouble with being on any film is that you are on that location for [only] a few days; by the time Orlando was okay to film this stuff, the entire crew had moved on to different scenes. We always thought that we would come back to do a couple of quick shots of Orlando as he lands in the saddle. We went through the rest of the shoot but never got those shots, because we had everything else to shoot. The whole thing was forgotten.\n\n>We wrapped up the film, but I always thought, \"Well, I'll grab those shots of Orlando when we do pick-ups.\" This past year, when we did the pick-ups for The Two Towers, every actor was available except for Orlando. He was doing the Ned Kelly film in Australia. They had him with a little beard and some facial hair, and they wouldn't allow us to grab him for a few days and shave his face, because he was in the middle of shooting, and they needed [that look] for their film. That effectively meant he couldn't participate in the pick-ups, and we couldn't do any new Legolas shots then.\n\n>[in the end], I never got those images of Orlando actually landing in the saddle. I was in the cutting room thinking, \"Oh my God, what the hell am I going to do?! We've got him standing on the ground; he turns around and reaches for the horse. The horse actually goes by him, and he is still standing there. I then have all this stuff of him galloping around on the horse but nothing to show him actually getting on the horse.\" So I had a problem. I looked at the shot of him where he is standing there, the horse is galloping up behind him, and he reaches out, and I thought, \"You know what? At this moment that he turns and reaches, if we then changed him into a CG [computer-generated] guy and animated him grabbing the saddle and swinging up and then painted out the real Orlando - who, on film, just continues standing there as the horses gallop by - we have a CG guy flipping around, doing this incredibly impossible acrobatic stunt. That would be pretty cool and certainly [solve] my problem of getting him on his horse.\" That's what we did. We actually did it because we were forced to do it - it was never a planned event. Orlando thought it was pretty cool, too!",

                    "text": "Well, there are quite a lot of things I want to say, so sit tight.\n\nTo start it off, I want to thank everyone who engaged in this series of memes. You made these two months some of the best in my life and it was absolutely amazing. I also want to give very special thanks to u/Raymesiris, u/StemmedAxis, u/Black-Forces-God, u/radiakmjs, and u/hotpotatodude. You have engaged in unprecedented ways and were essential to making this meme what it is now.\n\nNow, the decision to end the meme today may come as a shock to most. In fact, I wasn't going to stop today, until I was contacted by the moderators. They explained, in a very heartwarming message, that my posts were an exception to a could-be-seen-as violation of Rule 1(vote manipulation). They asked me to conclude it at day 66, so that this exception would no longer be in place. While a little frustrated, I understood that the rules were there long before me, and it would be unfair to continue opening an exception without good reason. That said, I would also like to thank the moderators for such an opportunity.\n\nI also took the decision to not continue it in a dedicated subreddit. As far as my participation is concerned, this meme belongs to r/prequelmemes. I do, however, give full permission for you guys to continue it in another subreddit(It would probably be important to appoint someone to be in charge).\n\nNow, as for the post itself, I decided to go out with a bang, by effectively doubling the collection at once. I used all of Ray's suggestions, as he was someone who maintained an amazing level of commitment ever since the first few posts. Thank you once again my friend.\n\nI also added in the Jedi Bob lightsaber and the Schwartz Ring, as those were also suggested by very committed and engaged users.\n\nI would like to apologize for all of you who suggested lightsabers in the Suggestion Board and whose suggestion never made it. It wanted to make a \"every suggested lightsaber\" instead, but I simply didn't have enough time. But once again, thank you for your commitment!\n\nNow for some shameless advertising: I invite you guys to check out my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqd1cEseKkmDJh901jSwnA). It doesn't have any content YET, but I will soon release some music covers, arrangements, remixes, and compositions. So if you are into that kind of stuff, subscribe. I will also make a video talking about this whole grievous experience, which should be pretty interesting.\n\nTo conclude, I hope everyone is safe. Stay at home and take care of your elders. These are thought times, and I feel extremely gratified to know I made it a little bit better for many of you. You sure did my time a lot more fun!\n\nPs: This isn't a goodbye! I'll still be active in the subreddit, and posting memes whenever an idea pops into my head!\n\nEdit: Fun Fact the file size was so big Reddit wasn’t accepting it, so I had to decrease the quality.\n\nEdit 2: RIP my inbox\n\nEdit 3: Anyone wanna calculate the amount of coins spent on this post?",

Indeed he had such a knowledge of the OC that he could be given awards out the wazoo. Eventually he became so popular that he became arrogant, unfortunately he got too big for his britches and mouthed off to a mod and got permabanned. Ironic, he could bring karma to himself, but got banned in the end.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.\n\n## Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

During their first Fight, Grievous was just toying with her. And she still ended up running. Their second Fight? Grievous had her if not for Hondo showing up with the Slave One. I'd hardly count either of these as a victory for Ahsoka over Grievous. More so an escape. \n\nVentress? She was fighting for her live and her people, driven by Anger and hatred, while on a Planet that has a natural connection to the dark side of the force.\n\nGrievous did often cheat during his duels, his Fight against Master Eeth Koth being a prime example. But really, the Magnaguards only stepped in once Koth used the force. You could argue it was Grievous simply evening the odds. That asside though, who said a duel during War had to be honorable? \n\nReally, while Grievous does Lose a lot of fights during the Clone Wars, his defeats all make perfect sense if you bother to think about them for more than two minutes instead of going \"GUNGANS?!?!??!\" -",

He's above average in both regards, but hardly \"the best\".\n\nIt's his mind. He represents the peak of Jedi teachings. He's well learned, analytical, and a master of his own mind and emotions. He took everything Qui Gon (the Jedi who saw how the Jedi had lost their way) taught him and everything Yoda (the most powerful, skilled and knowledgeable Jedi there was) taught him and combined them to be the perfect Jedi. He studies hard, he works hard, he's never overconfident, nor does he experience doubt. He knows EXACTLY how those would be weaknesses and how to exploit them. He uses Soresu a style of combat based not around winning through your own design, but surviving long enough for the opponent to make a mistake, and he was a master at that. \n\nGrevious represented a new challenge for him. He used light sabers, but he didn't fight like a Jedi. He had 4 light sabers at once, that could spin like helicopters leaving little to no opening. He was sufficiently machine that he would not easily tire out or make a mistake. He did not use the force or anything that Obi Wan had learned to counter. He was operating on pure strategy and unrelenting attack. He was Obi-Wan's weakness. \n\nAnakin, was the opposite. Obi-Wan knew his strengths and weaknesses inside and out. He knows that Anakin is stronger in the force and a better lightsaber duelist in the sense that if you ran a tournament Anakin would fair better. Obi-Wan's analytical mind, and the fact that he had raised Anakin meant there was absolutely no one that Obi-Wan could fight better against though. He knew every counter to everything Anakin was likely to throw at him because that's exactly what he had been training with. As long as he remained calm, he knew how to stay in the fight against Anakin for as long as Anakin would be able to fight because he did it before, and he knew exactly what mistakes Anakin was most likely to make. And that would be under normal conditions. Anakin was probably at his worst in that fight. He was emotionally chaotic, which is exactly what Obi-Wan knew how to exploit in Anakin, as even normally it's his greatest weakness. But also Anakin was actively switching from light side to dark side in this moment. A decent portion of what he learned as a Jedi wasn't going to work when tried from the Dark side position. At the same time though, he was almost completely inexperienced in any dark side techniques.",

(Sources also say Dooku only included himself out of fear of Grievous’s computing speed, which sometimes overwhelmed Dooku, putting him on the defensive during their sparring matches.) \n\nGrievous beat/forced Windu to flee three times, the last of which Windu sore to never fight him again after he would’ve been beheaded if not for a sudden explosion on the Courscant metro—and the fact the general was quickly honing Vapad. \n\nWindu—the man Lucas himself said defeated Palpatine—lamented such fear and failure to Yoda after the battle of Courscant. \n\nGrievous’ top speed was 20 saber strikes per second, decimating the physical and metaphysical (Force) stamina of even the most seasoned Jedi masters—severing them from the Force almost entirely until it became match only of Man v. Machine, where victory for the metal centipede was only a matter of time. \n\nThat’s why Grievous was taken aback when he lost two hands to Obi, who seemed to only become more powerful with the Force as they continued, the opposite of what Grievous is accustomed to and plans for; even so, Grievous still doesn’t waver—even as clones land en masse behind him—touting Obi with, “Army or not, you are doomed…” \n\nIt isn’t until Grievous loses his sabers after the force push does he finally flee. But, as OP says, even without his sabers, Grievous almost authored the very last moments of Obi-Wan on a fateful ledge on Utapau distant from the main battle. \n\n——\n\n(In fact, Palpatine had planned for Grievous to win.

He made it all way in hijacking some of their ships before the Republic reinforcements arrived and decimated the entire rebellion.

They didn't like that he was still a free spirit, however, so Dooku set up a shuttle disaster that left Qymaen crippled, leaving him no choice but to become a cyborg and underling to Dooku.\n\nGor was a roggwart that Greivous inherited from an elder in his community, and became very friendly with the animal, taking it with him when he went into his corporate-backed exile, keeping it fed and taken care of in his castle as a reminder of the home he would never again have.\n\nIn *Lair of Grievous*, it's literally a home invasion masterminded by his own boss.\n\nThe Jedi arrive looking to arrest or kill him, break into his home, kill his dog (who, because Dooku shut down the magnaguards in charge of feeding him, was starving), and maim him when he tried to defend his house.\n\nGrievous may be petty, but he has a few decades of grudge behind him to justify it.",

This was an unexpected strategy for the Mandalorians and was also very effective in wiping out the majority of their forces. \n\nIf this quote is alluding to a different Mandalorian war, then we do not know the specifics and he is a very biased source of information on the conflict.",

The entire thing was meant to be a trap, and obiwans monologue played into the trap by keeping him occupied on the bridge. The only reason he had for revealing that the self destruct was active is likely that he believed that by that point it was unlikely that grievous could escape, so he was rubbing it in his face that he’d been had.

The build up to it, and showing how little he had, and now even that is gone. But he knows who did it, so out he goes into the wider universe to avenge his aunt and uncle, to hunt down the killer of his father, and to become something greater and powerful (with the help of Obi-Wan). And then that promise of training, knowledge and *power* is taken away with the death of Obi-Wan after he thought he was finally on the up and up (successful rescue of princess, escape to ship.). He did break down at an inopportune time, but he had been suppressing all that pain and anguish with the hope of actually doing something about it.

Obi-Wan defeats him pretty easily.\n\nThis is a pretty normal pattern with Lucas, he told Joe Johnston to make the coolest dude ever with the Boba Fett armor design, and then decided that Boba would be a joke also in Return of the Jedi, and get accidentally killed by Han.\n\nSo the version of Grievous that you see in Revenge of the Sith, the underwhelming one, is how Lucas intended to depict him.

Fighting lightsaber v lightsaber meant both combatants were highly skilled and had put thought into the reasons for combat. Much simpler and easier to pull a trigger without much thought.\n\nThus, the lightsaber is a more civilized weapon for a most civilized age.

This doesn't apply to the Sith (they love inflicting pain) this is why maul attacked qui gon in such a way that he suffered for as long as possible. Jedi are taught to only draw their lightsabres as a last choice, they're mediators, healers and librarians before warriors.

Very different from how normal light saber engagements go. I'm sure it took Obi-wan some time to get used to, and eventually instead of trying to wear down his opponent he just uses a blaster, so uncivilized.\n\nTo dive a little deeper into things. Obi-wan specializes in lightsaber [form III ](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Form_III/Legends)that is better for prolonged engagements, maximizing energy efficiency.  The longer the fight goes the more his style will dominate. Anakin uses the more aggressive [form V](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Form_V/Legends#:~:text=On%20the%20Jedi%20side%2C%20Jedi,mastered%20both%20Form%20V%20variants), which often was used by fighters who wanted more aggression and focused on dominating the opponent.

He's above average in both regards, but hardly \"the best\".\n\nIt's his mind. He represents the peak of Jedi teachings. He's well learned, analytical, and a master of his own mind and emotions. He took everything Qui Gon (the Jedi who saw how the Jedi had lost their way) taught him and everything Yoda (the most powerful, skilled and knowledgeable Jedi there was) taught him and combined them to be the perfect Jedi. He studies hard, he works hard, he's never overconfident, nor does he experience doubt. He knows EXACTLY how those would be weaknesses and how to exploit them. He uses Soresu a style of combat based not around winning through your own design, but surviving long enough for the opponent to make a mistake, and he was a master at that. \n\nGrevious represented a new challenge for him. He used light sabers, but he didn't fight like a Jedi. He had 4 light sabers at once, that could spin like helicopters leaving little to no opening. He was sufficiently machine that he would not easily tire out or make a mistake. He did not use the force or anything that Obi Wan had learned to counter. He was operating on pure strategy and unrelenting attack. He was Obi-Wan's weakness. \n\nAnakin, was the opposite. Obi-Wan knew his strengths and weaknesses inside and out. He knows that Anakin is stronger in the force and a better lightsaber duelist in the sense that if you ran a tournament Anakin would fair better. Obi-Wan's analytical mind, and the fact that he had raised Anakin meant there was absolutely no one that Obi-Wan could fight better against though. He knew every counter to everything Anakin was likely to throw at him because that's exactly what he had been training with. As long as he remained calm, he knew how to stay in the fight against Anakin for as long as Anakin would be able to fight because he did it before, and he knew exactly what mistakes Anakin was most likely to make. And that would be under normal conditions. Anakin was probably at his worst in that fight. He was emotionally chaotic, which is exactly what Obi-Wan knew how to exploit in Anakin, as even normally it's his greatest weakness. But also Anakin was actively switching from light side to dark side in this moment. A decent portion of what he learned as a Jedi wasn't going to work when tried from the Dark side position. At the same time though, he was almost completely inexperienced in any dark side techniques.",

(Sources also say Dooku only included himself out of fear of Grievous’s computing speed, which sometimes overwhelmed Dooku, putting him on the defensive during their sparring matches.) \n\nGrievous beat/forced Windu to flee three times, the last of which Windu sore to never fight him again after he would’ve been beheaded if not for a sudden explosion on the Courscant metro—and the fact the general was quickly honing Vapad. \n\nWindu—the man Lucas himself said defeated Palpatine—lamented such fear and failure to Yoda after the battle of Courscant. \n\nGrievous’ top speed was 20 saber strikes per second, decimating the physical and metaphysical (Force) stamina of even the most seasoned Jedi masters—severing them from the Force almost entirely until it became match only of Man v. Machine, where victory for the metal centipede was only a matter of time. \n\nThat’s why Grievous was taken aback when he lost two hands to Obi, who seemed to only become more powerful with the Force as they continued, the opposite of what Grievous is accustomed to and plans for; even so, Grievous still doesn’t waver—even as clones land en masse behind him—touting Obi with, “Army or not, you are doomed…” \n\nIt isn’t until Grievous loses his sabers after the force push does he finally flee. But, as OP says, even without his sabers, Grievous almost authored the very last moments of Obi-Wan on a fateful ledge on Utapau distant from the main battle. \n\n——\n\n(In fact, Palpatine had planned for Grievous to win. That’s why he originally asked the Jedi council to send Anakin to kill Grievous, knowing the council would disapprove and send Obi instead to impart their own discretion in such matters. Either way, though, whoever died benefited Palpatine, because he needed them both in the mass grave of his machinations.)",

Nor use that himself. Grievous was none of them officially... so...\n\nI'd admit, the biggest disadvantage of exposing when having lightsaber turned off - when having total four of those - wouldn't be a disadvantage at all. I kinda even like the idea of Grievous' boring an opponent as a sieve with all four. Like a prison thug with makeshift blades. Badass.\n\nEDIT how could I forget, the Tartakovsky' Grievous used also feet to fight (also grabbing lightsabers), I would totally see this version using also Trákata tricks, the fight scene from animated Clone Wars is my favorite one\n\nEDIT 2 - i rewatched the scene and hey, Grievous totally made something similar - look from [3:43](https://youtu.be/WIj7gIDFDe4) he put his arm up, made K'Kruhk focus on blades (lightsaber still up in air), changed K'Kruhk's stance and grabbed lightsaber from the air just to make one final death strike, Grievous definitely had Trákata vibes in that fight!",

So fast forward, I finish episode 1, begin episode 2 and it begins with the attempted assassination of Padmé when her ship arrives. I'm thinking to myself, \"o ya this scene is actually pretty dark in the movie, how will they handle this?\" Well the ship blows up, Padmé runs up to the decoy Padmé and it's the same fucking moustached Lego guy. I fucking lost it.\n\nThis game has handled it's humor really weirdly tbh. Sometimes it's too childish and out of place, and sometimes it's almost too adult.

The old games have a lot more content per movie, while these seem to be a few key scenes. \n\nI just finished Empire last night as the second movie I’ve finished after ANH. Far from 100% on either! I feel like it is quicker to play a movie’s levels than it would be to watch the movie.\n\nIt is a Lego game so lots of room to find new stuff on second play-throughs. \n\nCharacters aren’t held to the expectations of previous games. Even the droid have melee attacks! Some abilities have been shifted to be more ‘class based’ so all Scoundrels (Han, Lando) have a purple ‘clever shot’ thing and can do a hero slide once unlocked, but Han actually makes jokes about no longer having a grapple ability (which has been moved to R2D2). And C3P0 actually has ‘going to pieces’ as his core ability allowing him to enter ducts and such like previous game’s “small” characters.\n\nThere’s been a bunch of really annoying bugs: disappearing faces/models, broken progression in some levels, etc. I haven’t seen these but it’s a fun game with the expectation that it’s a relatively relaxed game to mess around with. Great to play with kids I’d assume.",

It works with previous lego games where they had to pantomine the plot but with actual voices it feels like the movies on 4\\* speed which just feels distracting and awkward to me.\n\nO yea I agree about the Palpatine ROTJ design.

            "text": " [President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/) is pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization for a [second time](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/11/coronavirus-fact-check-donald-trump-vs-world-health-organization/5128799002/), the White House announced late Monday. \n\nThe [day-one executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/) fulfills Trump's campaign promise to reject global institutions. Health experts worry it isolates the U.S. with consequences for pandemic and disease response and diplomatic relations worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. is and has historically been the largest funder of the global health agency headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. WHO, part of the United Nations, is tasked with preparing for and fighting health emergencies. The U.S. has strongly influenced the agency since its founding after World War II.\n\nTrump criticized WHO for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as his administration faced [scrutiny for being slow to respond to the crisis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/15/trump-facing-criticism-covid-fight-he-delays-biden-transition/6302909002/). In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, [he began the process of pulling out from WHO](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/07/covid-19-trump-officially-withdraws-us-world-health-organization/5391909002/). \n\nDespite his promise, he failed to do so under U.S. law governing the timeline for withdrawal and funding obligations to the agency. Former [President Joe Biden reversed Trump’s decision](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/22/scientists-applaud-biden-decision-rejoin-world-health-organization/4243377001/) after taking office and restored funding to WHO.\n\nTrump’s executive order — on the first day of his second term rather than the last year of his first presidency — allows him to actually carry out his decision.\n\nThe order said the U.S. was withdrawing \"due to the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\" It also cited the \"payments \"unfairly onerous payments\" the U.S. has made to support the organization.\n\nDuring the Biden administration the U.S. continued its role as the largest funder of the agency, which has a budget of $6.8 billion in the current fiscal year. Nearly a fifth of WHO’s budget in 2023 came from the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. has been a part of WHO since 1948, the same year the organization launched, and the departure would make the nation the only major power that’s not a member of the 194-country body.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the agency will do everything to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration to continue to strengthen for global health security, Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, said in an email. The partnership between WHO and the U.S. has \"as protected and saved millions of lives in America and around the world,\" Jašarević said, citing the director-general.\n\n# ‘Grave strategic error,’ health experts say\n\nTrump’s announcement had been expected by health experts. In public and private, officials and academics raised concerns about the decision, which they said endangers the health of the nation and the world.\n\nIn December, Dr. Ashish Jha, the Biden White House’s former COVID-19 response coordinator, called it a “catastrophic mistake” for the global community and a “terrible mistake” for the U.S.\n\n“This is going to be a grave strategic error that will make America less healthy and less safe,” Lawrence Gostin, a global public health expert and the faculty director of Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, told USA TODAY.\n\n“The withdrawal itself is going to isolate the United States,” Gostin said. “It’ll isolate us diplomatically, and it’ll isolate us in pandemic response.”\n\n# How will U.S. withdraw from WHO?\n\nTrump’s order will require arduous disentangling of American and global health institutions woven together for 75 years.\n\nWHO’s [constitution](https://apps.who.int/gb/bd/pdf_files/BD_49th-en.pdf), [drafted in New York](https://www.who.int/about/history), doesn’t have a clear exit method for member states. A [joint resolution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decad052.asp) by Congress in 1948 outlined that the U.S. can withdraw with one year's notice. This is contingent, however, on ensuring that its financial obligations to WHO “shall be met in full for the organization’s current fiscal year.”\n\nThe U.S. is the only member state to have made such an exit strategy, Jašarević, of WHO, said. The former Soviet Union withdrew from WHO in 1949 during Cold War tensions, though returned years later.\n\nQuestions remain on how the U.S., and the rest of the world, will interact and respond to health emergencies in the future.\n\nThe U.S. leaving WHO would grievously weaken the global health agency from responding to outbreaks, conduct surveillance and cooperate closely, Gostin said.\n\n“Our public health agencies would be flying blind,” he said.\n\nFor example, the Pan-American Health Organization, WHO’s regional office for the Americas, is based in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has staff at WHO and elsewhere globally. \n\nAmerican response alongside WHO has been key in fighting diseases such as polio, which has been nearly eradicated, and HIV/AIDS, under a [President George W. Bush-era program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/11/04/pepfar-hiv-program-stuck-in-congress/71219513007/) that has helped curb transmission in several countries. The Bush program is considered a success both in public health and diplomatic relations.\n\nEven more technically, information-sharing between the U.S. and WHO has been key not only to disease response, but also pharmaceutical developments to rapidly innovate and create life-saving vaccines and treatments, Gostin said.\n\nGostin now worries of other emerging diseases and pandemic threats that could leave the U.S. weaker and more vulnerable. \n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the agency will do everything to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration to continue to strengthen for global health security, Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson, said in an email.

Then, the U.S. provided vaccines to its entire population before offering them to vulnerable people elsewhere, which struck many around the world as unfair.\n\n“In the next pandemic,” Gostin said, “we might find ourselves at the back of the line, on the outside looking in.”\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/20/trump-orders-us-exit-world-health-organization/77772989007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/20/trump-orders-us-exit-world-health-organization/77772989007/)",

Some of these are less common so I thought it would be interesting to post them.\n\nThere are many problems with it, but here are those on top of my head:\n\n— Disjointed storytelling. Most arc are independent of each other or weakly linked\n\n— Lack of nuance and where it is present it’s kinda blunted.\n\n— Many arc have no impact. Example: clone funding arc with Padme. It was badly written, but even then, there is no impact after of defeating the bill. It would seem that with lower funding on clones will have huge impact on the war, political balance, public perception of Padme etc. One could write a lot into this, something, anything.  But there is nothing. Abysmal. And this negligence happens almost all the time. Mortis arc too.\n\n— Le Force Dudes (Mortis arc) and the idiotic contradictory balance of the force. Lucas should have fired his entire team here (Alas)\n\n— Ahsoka. She is a cool idea really, Obiwan feeding Anakin his own medicine, but oh well we all know what happened. Also she doesn’t “grow” as a character, more rewritten every time Filoni needed to.\n\n— Absolutely atrocious, ugly like plague Jedi terror bombing and the order kicking Ahsoka out. This is morbidly stupid. Filoni needed Jedi order to be bad so he shits out this cancer of an arc.\n\n— War is not explained. War is not really depicted. It’s just random battles. There is no explanation or over all picture of the wars. Very disappointing. On screen the good guys win, but off screen the bad guys loose.\n\n— General Grievous. I pity him so much. He didn’t deserve this. I don’t know why the writers hate him.\n\n—Darth Maul resurrection. Damn you, Lucas!\n\n— Witches magic voodoo crap. Wtf?\n\n— Political system not explained. To be fair, they did dig into it, but lack in both depth and breadth. Very disappointing.\n\nThat is everyone I could remember so far. Throw me your points\n\nEdit:  a lot of things that people criticize Disney for today, was first done here by Finoli. Character assassinantions, chasing the ends, Mary Sue, bs retcons, squandered EU/legends. In retrospect, TCW was a harbinger of doom for Star Wars.",

He's characterized as a generic quippy jedi general who never develops but happens to have a few OMG HE'S ACTUALLY EVIL moments sprinkled into the story but then immediately skipped over for the sake of the next inconsequential story arc.\n\nThe idea of Anakin getting a padawan is frankly a huge contrivance too. You're telling me the jedi councilors who never trusted Anakin would give him, an arrogant immature superpowered hothead, a padawan to train in the middle of a galactic war while he's bouncing between battlefields trying to lead clone armies? I'm sorry but no matter what justification you try to push for it, it'll always be contrived.\n\nThere's a few good episodes in there and there are definitely much worse SW shows but I'm not a huge fan of it either. It feels too much like some superfans became writers and wanted to play with their favorite toys in all kinds of prequel scenarios, and too little like bridging the gap between episodes II and III.

The CWMMP was a vastly superior telling of the Clone Wars, Filoni essentially Thanos-snapped over half of that material out of existence.

In fact later EU authors were forced to retroactively make lore revisions (such as Ableloth's origins) just to make TCW somewhat make sense.\n\nFiloni was Disney SW before Disney bought the IP, writing glorified fanfiction warping the established canon to fit his mary sue's needs.\n\nI also really hate the savior complex Filoni has and how people say TCW \"saved\" the prequels. The people who say TCW \"saved\" the prequels don't understand the prequels, I firmly am in the camp that the prequels were actually good movies and TCW *harms* the prequels more than anything. The CWMMP feels like it belongs with the prequels way more than TCW does (especially with a more realistic trajectory for Anakin's character based on how George wrote him).\n\nI get the feeling people only jack off TCW and Filoni because he's better than JJ Abrams or Rian Johnson, but that bar of standard isn't exactly high. If you ask me the ones who've shown they are best fits for Star Wars post-Lucas are Edwards and Gilroy, but the Mouse doesn't like them much I guess.\n\nBut anyways, the only real \"essential\" viewing from TCW that I would ever recommend to people would be the Yoda arc from Season 6 since Lucas wrote that and it goes inside Lucas' head on how the Force works, but other than that just no.",

I miss gray Jedi. I miss the Whills. \n\nI’m fine with keeping things mostly light vs. dark, but it makes complete sense there are groups of people who are like “screw both of them. We’re doing our own thing.” Groups that derive from the light, dark and in between using their side of the Force in non traditional ways. The important thing for writing is for these groups to keep to themselves to avoid to big of an impact on the Galaxy and it’s conflicts. This usually involves adding a lot of cultural details which adds to the worldbuilding in a great way. As always the key is good writing. Which I find Filoni hit and miss at best and current writers… laughable.",

She is a cool idea really, \n\nI think she should've been friends with Anakin but, been Plo Koon's apprentice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> There is no explanation or over all picture of the wars. Very disappointing. On screen the good guys win, but off screen the bad guys loose. \n\nYeah I can agree with this. It doesn't it ruin it for me but, a better sense of the big picture would be great. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> General Grievous. \n\nI agree here too. He doesn't need to be as ultra badass as he was in Tartakovsky's Clone Wars but, they should've made him more competent and less cowardly. \n\nHe also never should've fought Obi Wan. Have him fight other Jedi but, the fight in RotS makes it seem like that was the first time Obi Wan fought Grievous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Darth Maul resurrection \n\nYeah it's dumb. I do like the story that came after it but, him surviving is dumb. Perhaps he shouldn't have been killed so early in the first place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Witches magic voodoo crap. Wtf? \n\nYeah I agree. I do like the concept of another culture of force users that aren't Jedi or Sith but, their powers are just too soft magic. I especially hate how Mother Talzin can like become intangible and manifest objects out of nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  In retrospect, TCW was a harbinger of doom for Star Wars. \n\nOverall, I don't think TCW is nearly as bad as most Disney stuff. I enjoy a decent amount of it. Filoni DOES care about Star Wars, he just needs someone to tell him \"this is a bad idea\" sometimes, same as George.",

The clone wars has a different characterization of Anakin that’s about all you got right there. \n\nI think the characterization matches pretty closely with how he is presented in the first couple minutes of revenge of the Sith, which is the only time Anakin feels like a real enjoyable character or a hero. The clone wars does bridge the gap and almost clarifies his defining character flaw. His flaw is his inability to let go. He is never able to accept that sometimes he can’t save everyone. We see him throughout the clone show as a hero and a courageous Jedi knight, which feels a lot closer to the way Obi-Wan described him in a new Hope, and every time they present his secretly evil side it is always connected to his inability to accept loss. He goes out of his way to try and save his friends and the people he cares about no matter the cost. That can easily be seen as a heroic trait, but we can also see the way it is going to lead him down a dark path. Revenge of the Sith feels sort of confused about why Anakin is going to switch sides since it’s both that he feels betrayed by the Jedi order and that they’ve undercut him, and that he wants to save Padme. But with the context of the clone wars, it seems to clarify that the defining flaw that brought him to the dark side is his inability to accept loss and pain and his determination to save everyone, especially those that he loves. And that is present in the movies, but at the expense of him being an actual hero. The clone wars find a nice way to balance those two attributes and makes his defining character flaw. What makes him a hero, and what brings him to the Dark side.\n\nAlso, yeah, it is a bit contrived that he got a padawan on but I think it serves the story and it’s a children’s show so I’m willing to let it slide since it makes for a better story even if it’s a bit silly.\n\nI’m sure all of that came off a little hostile, so I wanna pull back a little bit and say I respect your opinion and you don’t have to like it. You are more than welcome to prefer the prequels. I find Anakin in the prequels to be whiny and unlikable. He sounds nothing like the hero Obi-Wan describes in a new hope , the clone war Anakin does. I wish that the films had made Anakin more like he is in the show.",

They had to rein him in somehow and give any credence to Obi-wan's description of him to Luke. \n\nFor all the issues the Ahsoka series has, Hayden's seamless bridging of the three portrayals of Anakin (counting AotC and RotS Anakin separately) shows how conceivable they were as the same character imo.",

He goes from someone who could have been one of the greatest Jedi's of all time, to a Sith who exists to be a placeholder and tossed aside when someone better comes along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Obi-wan...You mean the dude who lied about Anakin the first time he talks to Luke about him?",

Then Trump wins reelection and Redditors can't understand how.\n\nWith the survivors of bans on Reddit either being on the left and talking about politics, or on the right and not talking about politics, the left-leaning subreddits simply don't have this problem. Most of the site is often just people on the left arguing with people on the far left and anyone else who doesn't want to get banned stays silent.",

Instant permaban for going against the narrative by literally just stating a fact with zero commentary.  The ban message said I was \"spreading terrorist apologia\".\n\nI got banned from r/news for posting an NPR interview with Emmet Till's cousin who was with him the day he whistled at that woman that led to his murder.  Someone said he didn't whistle at her and stuttered or something?  And I linked to actually a few articles with Emmett's family members who were with him where they all confirmed, yeah he wolf whistled at her.  I made it VERYYYYYYY clear in my comment that doesn't at all mean he deserved anything close to what happened to him- once again just clarified a fact that went against the narrative- again instant permaban.\n\nI got banned from r/politics for pointing out those pictures of \"kids in cages\" that made the rounds were taken during Obama's term in 2014, with a link to the original Arizona Republic (or something) article they'd been posted in.  Again instant permaban for clarifying a fact.\n\nAgain in none of these comments did I say ANYTHING remotely close to justifying what happened to Breonna Taylor/Emmett Till/unaccompanied minors crossing the border.  I do not think any of those things were remotely close to justified.  Literally just stated a fact with links to sources (and trustworthy sources, not like right-wing sites).  Personally I'm nowhere close to right-wing, nowhere close to a Trump supporter, I just think sometimes the truth is bad enough that you don't have to lie about it?  Like does it fundamentally change or justify anything that happened if we know the police who shot *through the door* at Breonna Taylor were wearing vests when they couldn't be seen *through a door* anyway?  So why lie about that?  But that simple fact was not allowed to be shared.\n\nIdk people think the \"big\" subs on reddit like r/news or r/politics aren't just as biased and moderated as more fringe subs but they really are.

If you want to assure your place in heaven sell all that you own and give it to the poor. Be humble. You will know them by their fruits.\n\nYet conservative ideology imprisons those seeking help. It cuts funding for those that are hungry. It kicks those that need medical care off of insurance. It says \"My Money. My money. My Money. I will not give MY MONEY to anyone that needs help because I think that all those with dark skin are unworthy and are stealing from me.\" But the bible says even if that is the case\n\nMatthew 25:34-36 *Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’*\n\nRomans 12:17-21 *Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.*\n\n*Mark 10:21-22 Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, ‘You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.’ When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.*\n\n*Luke 14:12-14 He said also to the one who had invited him, ‘When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.’*\n\n*Matthew 5:38-42 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would rob you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.\"*",

It is most succinctly summed up as the idea that the law/government should exist to protect an entitled in-group without restricting them, and should exist to restrict an exploited out-group(s) without protecting them. The right to rule over others is what they are trying to conserve.\n\n**Little-\"c\" conservative** is the idea of being risk-averse and cautious. Some examples would be a \"conservative estimate\" when looking at multiple sets of data, or a \"conservative line of play\" in a sporting event or game.\n\nWhat Big-\"C\" Conservatives have done in the propaganda space is to convince little-\"c\" conservatives that these are the same thing. They mask their protection of the aristocracy with claims that they are \"protecting tradition\", and play into the little-\"c\" conservatives' aversion to risk and fear of change to \"get back to the old ways\". The specific traditions that each little-\"c\" conservative wants to conserve are meaningless to the Big-\"C\" conservatives, and they will tailor their appeal to each little-\"c\" demographic even if those specific appeals have elements that are disagreeing/competing/mutually exclusive. All that matters is getting as many ignorant and scared people as possible to say \"I'm conservative\" so that when the time for elections (or any other collection of power) comes around they will be psychologically conditioned to say \"I'm Conservative\" while giving their power to the Big-\"C\" Conservatives.\n\n\"Fiscally conservative\" is a term that is designed to allow little-\"c\" conservatives to avoid having to change from the Big-\"C\" serving rut they are in when faced with cultural pressure from their peers. It is a part of the term \"socially liberal, but fiscally conservative\", which means that they support the Big-\"C\" politically, but don't want to be treated as if they are racist/classist/bigoted or any of the other \"traditions\" that the Big-\"C\" incorporated into appeals to specific little-\"c\" groups. Basically, \"I'm not going to change my political position because change is scary to me and I'm unable to admit I could have been in the wrong, and am going to continue supporting political leaders that have policies that are horrible for society, but I expect you to not treat me like I'm the kind of weirdo that supports the things I support.\"\n\n**Trump is NOT financially conservative in the little-\"c\" sense** because he isn't cautious or risk adverse, and doesn't uphold financial traditions that are proven to work. He's doing everything he can to cut federal programs that invest money to help the populace (which tend to have a great ROI for the nation) so that he can siphon off funds. He's making radical changes (like running pump-and-dump schemes on the nation's largest financial markets) and causing chaos in order to create opportunities that he and his cronies can exploit to consolidate power.\n\n**Trump IS financially Conservative in the Big-\"C\" sense** because he's doing all those things to tear down the democracy that the public has built to govern itself in order to replace it with a ruling aristocracy.",

The details are greatly appreciated, how mace windu crushes him to give grievous his signature cough, count dooku recommending he should retreat at times, the Vader visions and of course the battle on Yavin IV.\n\nGrievous in Rots while impressive only gets his moment in the spotlight very briefly and in the 3D clone wars show he becomes a bit of a “villain of the week” but still having his moments. My favourite quote of his from the 3D show is: *“I do not care about your politics! I don't care about your, Republic! I only live to see you die!\"* Grievous didn’t care about governing power or otherwise ruling the Galaxy, his sole purpose was to destroy the Jedi.\n\nThe 2D show turns Grievous into a legitimate horror movie villain creating shock whenever he appears from the initial appearance taking on the 5 stranded jedi and wiping the floor with them to the attack on Coruscant where Shaak Ti panics just by hearing his footsteps again. Then when he does appear after creeping into the scene he is a pure devastating force.\n\nI hope this version of clone wars being redistributed may lead to other artistic interpretations of Star Wars stories in the animated short form. Basically just give Genndy Tartakovsky everything he’d need for another round of this show potentially based in the OT or sequels.",

Basically it’s stories that are really fun and really exciting, but they’re a view on Star Wars, not necessarily canon to him. That was the way it was from the day I walked into Lucasfilm with him all through Clone Wars, everything we worked on, he felt the Clone Wars series and his movies were what was actually the reality of it all, the canon, then there was everything else. So it wasn’t a big dynamic shift for me mentally when there was this big announcement saying the EU is now Legends. I’m like, ‘Okay, well, it’s kind of the same thing to me because that the way I work.’”\n\n>–[Dave Filoni, ComicBook.com, September 2017](https://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/02/20/star-wars-lucasfilm-legends-expanded-universe-george-lucas/)\n\n>The way George explained it to me going in was that THE CLONE WARS micro-series was really an experiment to see what kind of audience there was for Star Wars in an animated form. There have been droids and Ewoks, but that was a long time ago. So he brought out THE CLONE WARS micro-series, and it was super action-packed and exciting and really short installments. And it proved that people wanted to see STAR WARS in a lot of different mediums. So when we into doing this, I think that, now that George is done with the prequels, he wanted to reestablish the rules a little bit more, like \"Mace Windu can't take out hundreds of battle droids by himself, otherwise the arena on Geonosis would've been a wipeout; [The jedi] would've won, and there be no Clone Wars. Those are exciting installments, but we don't tie directly into them; we tie more directly into the film that preceded us, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and the one that comes after us, REVENGE OF THE SITH. We take cues from [Tartakovsky's series]. I definitely pay a big homage to them in some of the design look of it. Anakin wears an outfit that was definitely inspired by what we saw in the other CLONE WARS. But there's no direct link-up.\n\n>-[Dave Filoni, 2008.](http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/37720) \n\n>Ryan: Speaking of your version of “Clone Wars,” does it bother you that there’s another one and that the one you did seems to no longer be canon?\n\n>Tartakovsky: Yeah. I mean, you know, of course it bothers me. But, you know, it’s George’s characters. It’s his world and he has to do what he has to do. And the new ones are totally inspired by what we did: A lot of the same character designs and stuff. \n\n>-[Genndy Tartakovsky, ‘Hotel Transylvania’ Director, On The Disappearance Of His Version Of ‘Star Wars: Clone Wars’, 2012.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/genndy-tartakovsky-hotel-transylvania_n_1884046)",

Reagan actually increased taxes. Trump's single piece of legislation increased taxes on the middle class. You're right when you say they simply want control.

Also appreciate the opportunity to engage. \n\nIf I understand correctly, you think that \"personally pro life but let people do what they want/government, butt out\" and \"pro choice\" should stay in different camps so that it's easier to rebut fully \"pro life\" stances?\n\nLet me know if that's incorrect. I grew up in that weird 'middle world' where I was personally pro life but felt government shouldn't impose religious restrictions on the general population... but would have been shunned by family, church, etc if I took the mantle of \"pro choice\", because \"pro choice\" = \"anti Christian\"/\"pro-abortion\". \n\nThere's validity to running \"underground\" in those ultra conservative circles and bringing up the \"I'm pro life, I just think that the gov't shouldn't be forcing its way on other people, reminds me of...\" and insert scripture reference here. Has a chance of actually having a discussion and convincing people to vote for the ability to have a choice. I do that, to a degree, with my family still. (I'm aggressively pro-choice at this point and in a church that is also aggressively so, but for the sake of not being fully written off by my family, tend to be very roundabout when expressing my beliefs instead of using hot-button words.)\n\nHowever, there's also a lot to be gained from making the \"pro choice\" movement a movement that spans multiple belief systems and parties, which it already does, but encouraging that by keeping the \"I wouldn't personally, but you need to let everyone make that choice\" crowd. \n\nWhy is that? People saying \"I'm morally and ethically opposed to abortion, and ***even I*** think that pro-choice is the right, Godly thing to be doing\" takes another huge wallop to the pro-life crowd, because it forces them to dialogue with \"their own people\" (straight up until they call the other person not a Christian etc). It chips away at the only major defense they have, the moral one, by saying \"people who share the same beliefs as you disagree that this is the correct way to be practicing them\". \n\nIn the end... easy to argue both ways, think it boils down to where the individual is, but I feel the individual should be welcomed into either group because either way, it's a net win for the pro-choice crowd. (the irony of me arguing for personal choice is not lost on me lol)",

When you need an outside guide to determine a linear watch through of a television serious, yeah, that sucks. And I watched Clone Wars as it came out on Cartoon Network and the constant back and forth of the first two and half seasons in time was annoying. It's easy to loose the threads and connectivity of certain arcs when some are literally just one episode in one later season that is actually the first episode of an arc starting with an episode from a previous season. That's my problem with The Clone Wars, especially when friends want to get into it because they have to follow a labyrinth to experience it properly.\n\nAs for all the other complaints...they clearly didn't see the behind the scenes videos with Dave Filoni which basically all amounted to him speaking with George Lucas himself for a great deal of The Clone Wars' production. This Including the Witches, Darth Maul's Return, the Mortis Arc. All of that. Like Everything Filoni did with Lucas approval. They even damn Lucas for the Maul resurrection in this post when they are trying to blame it all Filloni and uh, Lucasfilm as a whole. This has nothing to do with Disney so isn't the usual diatribe about Kennedy and Woke nonsense it's supposedly like the peak of Star Wars content under the eyes of the genius George Lucas, but apparently that isn't good enough for this person for reasons they poorly explain if at all in their so called critique. Honestly I made a better point about what I disliked about the series more articulately with one point while still being able to say I'm a fan of The Clone Wars. I Just admit it's hard to recommend to others as it's a chore to actually watch properly in order and watching it as it was released was confusing. Everything else this person says is just nonsensical complaints, without any substance and due to most of it relating to the Clone Wars' original run he clearly didn't realize that George Lucas was all over the project with Dave Filoni acting as George's practical protege. They clearly don't have an idea of what they want and just want to blame what didn't like on someone.  \n\n\nDidn't want to reply but felt I need to for once seeing as for all they said in their discussion of flaws, nothing a value was by this individual at all.",

And the arrangement of the stories. I get the desire to see everything as it happens chronologically, and there would certainly be a tonal whiplash from watching the Malevolence Arc and then skipping straight to something complete different with the Umbara arc, but even then, that can be seen as a juxtaposition of the lighter, more adventure-esque stories with the more serious, \"hard ships of war\".\n\nBasically, I don't think there's really a wrong way to watch the clone wars that isn't just like, backwards or skipping through arcs.

            "text": "I'm constantly bugged by how a lot of fictional stories about big conflicts and political drama just don't feel... real. \"Well, duh! That's because it's fiction!\" No, that's not what I mean. I mean like it's like the fate of entire nations or armies always comes down to, like, two or three main characters on each side doing *everything* important.\n\nIt's not just that the top leaders are directly involved in every little thing (though that's part of it). It's more like the story world feels super small-scale, even when it's supposed to be massive. You've got these huge wars and political webs, but it always boils down to a tiny handful of main characters making all the decisions and having all the impact. Everyone else just feels like background noise.\n\nI mean, when events often seem *too* perfect. *Too* cliched. If that makes sense? Like when there's no middle men in stories that have are supposed to have thousands and thousands of players. Which I guess is so the reader/viewer doesn't have to remember a thousand names and characters. I understand that as the average person doesn't want to be burdened with that. But it doesn't necessarily have to be this way.  \n  \nLet's look at Star Wars as a perfect example. Literal galaxy-sized scale conflicts as its backdrop, the actual agency and impact often seem concentrated within a very small circle of individuals. The Separatist war effort largely revolves around Dooku and Grievous... and then a bunch of randoms who nobody remembers. Meanwhile, the fate of the Republic often rests on the shoulders of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and only a few other prominent Jedi. Like yes, the scale of the conflict is shown to be much bigger, but it's all in the background or exists more as setting pieces for much smaller-scale storytelling. Which is FINE!  \n  \nI get that that the main emotional heart of any story can only really be within a small cast, I understand that. That is not what I'm criticizing here. What I'm talking about is that... feeling, that the weight of these massive conflicts rests almost entirely on a few key people, making the whole thing feel less believable and more... I don't know, just manufactured? As in the \"complexity\" of these stories are meant to be implied or understood by the viewer, but not actually seen.   \n  \nWhat this does, in my opinion, is take me out of the immersion of even the most serious of stories. Because real wars and political upheavals involve countless individuals making decisions and taking actions at various levels, not just a handful of central figures constantly at the forefront. Like the LEADER of the Jedi dueling the LEADER of the Sith in Episode III. Like bro? That doesn't seem at all contrived to you? When in history have kings or leaders had one-on-one DUELS with each other? Now, I'm not saying that to bash Star Wars, that scene was EPIC. What I'm saying is scenes or story beats in this same vein, where pivotal large-scale outcomes hinge on highly improbable personal confrontations, make the world-building feel inherently tiny and overly focused on the main characters. When they're supposed to feel large scale and epic, at least, that's what I'd assume the writers are usually going for, but they often undermine that very goal through this concentrated focus on a select few.\n\nI think this tendency in storytelling, while perhaps streamlining the story for a general audience, ultimately sacrifices a sense of believable scale and complexity. It creates a world where the weight of history rests on the shoulders of a surprisingly small number of individuals, diminishing the impact and believability of the grand conflicts being portrayed. Now, I'm not saying that every grand story has to have a thousand characters to be believable, I'm just saying there has to be some kind of balance here to where it's not *soooo* obviously contrived. Like having the protagonist and antagonists being to each other in a universe of thousands or having \"chosen ones\" who defeat a mighty empire or whatever. It's just... silly and childish storytelling.\n\nThat's just my opinion though. Feel free to kill me if you disagree.",

I think it really boils down to the series being created by people who think that interpersonal drama is sexy and politics and the military are fundamentally boring.\n\nOf course they're wrong, and I think a lot of the tension of popular media like *Clear and Present Danger*, *Sicario*, and the original *Call of Duty Black Ops* comes from understanding the complex web of jurisdictions between different departments and nations governing a war and the sense of anxiety of being pushed into an escalating firefight by a national bureaucratic war machine so intricate that it's hard to even figure out who's controlling it.",

He is loved.   \n>  \n>Even the rumor of his disappearance strikes a dagger to the heart of every friend of the Republic. Every one of them knows it in her heart, in his gut, in its very bones--  \n>  \n>Without Palpatine, the Republic will fall.  \n>  \n>And now confirmation comes through, and the news is worse than anyone could have imagined. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been captured by the Separatists -- and not just the Separatists.  \n>  \n>He's in the hands of General Grievous.  \n>  \n>Grievous is not like the other leaders of the Separatists. Nute Gunray is treacherous and venal, but he's Neimoidian: venality and treachery are expected, and in the Chancellor of the Trade Federation they're even virtues. Poggle the Lesser is Archduke of the weapons masters of Geonosis, where the war began: he is analytical and pitiless, but also pragmatic. Reasonable. The political heart of the Separatist Confederacy, Count Dooku, is known for his integrity, his principled stands against what he sees as corruption in the Senate. Though they believe he's wrong, many respect him for the courage of his mistaken convictions.  \n>  \n>These are hard beings. Dangerous beings. Ruthless and aggressive.  \n>  \n>General Grievous, though--  \n>  \n>Grievous is a ***monster***.  \n>  \n>The Separatist Supreme Commander is an **abomination of nature**, a fusion of flesh and droid -- and his droid parts have more compassion than what remains of his alien flesh. This half-living creature is a slaughterer of billions. Whole planets have burned at his command. He is the evil genius of the Confederacy. The architect of their atrocities.  \n>  \n>The author of their atrocities.\n\nNow that's some \\*chef's kiss\\* writing. Grievous's character design is monstrous and badass, along with the voicework done by Matthew Wood. A lot of us remember the battle at Hypori from the 2D Clone Wars, where he slaughters the Jedi Mystery Gang and it's played like a horror film. In fact, throughout most of that series has premium Grievous content, whether he's training in the Jedi Arts by Count Dooku, or leading the raid on Coruscant. \n\nMy question is, is there still room for that characterization in the current canon? His portrayal is consistent with how he is in Episode 3, but not necessarily with all the EU stuff I listed above. He oscillates between a truly deadly Jedi hunter and a coward in the 3D Clone Wars animated series. I would love to see more new Clone Wars content featuring many of those characters like Cad Bane, Mace Windu, etc., but maybe none moreso than General Grievous himself.",

In TFA, Hux was basically Kylo’s rival from within the FO. Hux had so much favor with Snoke that even Kylo dare not lay a finger on him. Given Kylo’s insane temperament and amount of power, that’s *serious.* And for the viewer, it’s a fun dynamic to see. Hux was cold, calculating, and vicious. He personally ordered a *massive* war crime that killed trillions of people, and when Starkiller began collapsing, Snoke made it clear that he wanted Hux off the base safely.\n\nNow, on to episode 8... *que Benny Hill theme* Hux is the butt end of “yo momma” jokes, and the victim of prank phone calls from Poe. He has no idea how to command the FO fleet and relies upon his generals to do it for him. He gets tossed around by Kylo like a rag doll. Yo, Rian Johnson, I’m no big fancy Hollywood executive, but making your antagonist double as the *comedic relief* is a *baaaad* idea. It totally retcons Hux’s character and deflates all tension and drama derived from the war in your movie called “Star Wars.”",

To do this you need competent people on both sides, the galaxy has to be pushed to the edge and the Jedi need to be threatened.\n\nOld Grievous did all of that, he wasn't some joke because Palpatine is competent enough to deal with people that aren't just idiots. He was exactly what the quote from the book said a monster to the wider galaxy and a threat because if he's a joke like TCW makes him his existence would literally be at risk everytime he comes up against a jedi. Instead you build someone who is capable of taking down all but the very best.\n\nThe idea Palpatine wouldnt allow there to be a Grievous that might defeat his future apprentice missed the point of the sith. It's trial by fire if he had a potential apprentice that Grievous could beat then they wouldnt be that great to begin with all sith are put in situations they can die from and the idea is always \"if you dont make it you weren't worth it anyway.\"\n\nDooku is also still above Grievous but this also goes into of TCW fails with that character to who used to be comparable to Yoda and Mace in legends(with Lucas actually saying in AotC in the force Dooku is equal to Yoda) so it was a big deal when Anakin beat him. Taking him down to someone Vos beats and is outsmarted by pirates is another terrible aspects of TCW because it mishandled almost all the villains and the separatists as a whole. They just lose. Every arc basically ends in a loss the way the show makes it seem is the Republic just wins basically every time rather than what the MMP showed the war to be an extreme back and forth that had competent people on both sides.",

Or an American colonist fighting against England.\n\nThat allows the writing, acting, and style to fall into place. \n\nI think the better Star Wars projects have succeeded in this. The poorer received shows were just shows where the genre was \"Star Wars\".\n\nThe first 2 seasons of The Mandalorian succeeded because it was a Western that happened to take place in Star Wars. The 3rd season, the genre just became \"Star Wars Show.\"\n\nSkeleton Crew was a pirate focused Amblin movie style show. \n\nThe Bad Batch was The A-Team meets 3 Men and a Baby in a political war thriller.\n\nI think why the Clone Wars is so beloved is the show as a whole wasn't 1 genre. But each arc was a different genre with a war as the backdrop. So there is something for everyone.\n\nMany people didnt like the Acolyte. That was rather genreless. It was marketed as a whodunnit, but us and the characters in the show knew who the killer was immediately.  I think if there were multiple viable options to be The Stranger and there was a big reveal in the penultimate episode with the audience and the characters trying to figure out who it was, the show would have been received better. Especially with the show having the message, don't believe everything you see. \n\nSame goes for Obi-Wan Kenobi and Book of Boba Fett. They felt like they didnt know what genre they wanted to be. Supposedly Book of Boba Fett was a crime/mob show, but the mob boss is against crime? Kenobi could have been a 80s/90s action movie throwback with hin trying to rescue Leia. He was the guy who jumped down infront of General Grievous with the \"Hello there\" line. It could have been a Western about Kenobi trying to defend Tattooine from Inquisitors without being outed as a Jedi. It could have been a straight family drama about a man trying to turn his \"brother\" back from being evil. Instead it was nothing. \n\nI just think moving forward, every SW show and movie should have a clear and defined genre. \n",

I *LOVE* Andor and think it’s among the best Star Wars we have ever received (period!), but what I love about this franchise is how diverse it can be. I love the high fantasy elements of the Skywalker Saga movies or Ahsoka, as well as the lighthearted adventure take inspired by Goonies that we got with Skeleton Crew. I love the Western we got in The Mandalorian, but also the super serious political thriller that is Andor. Star Wars can offer us an immense variety and we shouldn’t lose focus of that only because Andor worked really well.\n\nRather, we should think about *why* Andor worked so well: Tony Gilroy and his team had a story they wanted to tell - a story about the rise of fascism, about what drives people to abuse their power for personal gains and the atrocities they are willing to commit for the sake of said power, but also about those who are fed up with this corruption and how resistance comes about. This is a story that would have worked perfectly without the Star Wars IP in something like a historical drama, it just *happens* to take place within the galaxy far, far away. And that’s the point: before they started, they had a story and interesting characters, the Star Wars IP just provided the setting. They also placed a heavy emphasis on great cinematography, real locations and massive physical sets, while avoiding the cost-cutting volume as much as possible. THESE are the lessons that Lucasfilm and fans alike should take away from this. It’s not so much about the themes and the dark tone of Andor and more so about good writing and meticulous attention to detail. The show felt really well-made, which is something I can’t say about most of the other Star Wars shows. For instance, while I still enjoy the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, it often looked very cheap and its writing was all over the place to the extent where I firmly believe that it was simply rushed out the door in order to quickly provide content for Disney+.",

I would say her biggest miss step is knowing one person couldn't be the creative for the whole trilogy and getting 2 directors who view Star Wars very differently. \n\nThe trilogy 100% could have been handed from one person to the next, if they had similar views on Star Wars.\n\nI think that's why Filoni and Favreau work together so well. They see the franchise similarly.",

The goal should be to build upon what came before, not to repeat it.\n\nGilroy said he wasn't really a Star Wars fan and I think that's great, his goal is to make something good, not to appease his nostalgia",

I’m kind of cheating with this one since when they first appeared in the story during the black swordsman arc they were certainly threatening, but didn’t have the same chilling buildup that this trope is about. However, during the golden age arc (which is the beginning of the story chronologically), their buildup - helped by the fact that we know they do SOMETHING bad, just not what - is nail-biting. There are other things that add to this (like the slow introduction to apostles via Zodd and Wyald), culminating in the infamous Eclipse. Needless to say, by this point the true nature of the Berserkerverse rears its ugly head in one of the most nightmarish sequences in Manga history.",

As a man, I haven’t consumed much media that conveys the hair-raising threat of sexual violence (albeit not directly sexual in the movie, but def a metaphor for it (luv u A24)) as well as this character in this film.\n\nHighly recommend “I saw the TV Glow” for anyone who is down for a dark yet nostalgic and deeply original trip of a movie that explores all the shadowy possibilities of what might be real when absolutely nothing feels that way.",

From her ordering around previous big bad Spider Queen, to briefly showing her true appearance in a Demon Revealing Mirror which terrifies a minion, to a popular moment where Sun Wukong recognizes her and attempts to destroy her during the second special, claiming that “you should’ve stayed buried”, prompting him to leave to find a way to defeat her at the end of the special. Anyone who recognizes her is terrified, and we learn why when she reveals herself to MK, effortlessly tearing him apart using just her words, preying on his insecurities and fears and bringing him to his knees.

You're assaulted with the screams of the crews of the ship as something absolutely horrific happens to them. And then you hear it talking.\n\n\"WE LIVE\"\n\nAnd then eventually you find out the situation is so much worse.

The Briggs soldiers enter Sloth's tunnel, and are immediately massacred by a shadow monster\n\nA rescue team is sent after them, and the survivors are so terrified that they'd rather walk in complete darkness than face whatever that was. The shadow, still lurking, starts to retreat...\n\nAnd the scene cuts to Hawkeye in Bradley's home. Mrs. Bradley calls for her son, Selim, and you hear that sound of a moving shadow. Hawkeye turns around, and Selim is there. She starts chatting with Mrs. Bradley, and she reveals that Selim was adopted from a relative of her husband (aka Wrath)\n\nSuddenly, both Hawkeye and the audience have that horrifying realization. Hawkeye leaves their house, trying to make sense of what she just heard, but then you hear that voice, calling her from the shadows.\n\nIt's Selim. He knows that Hawkeye found out. He starts surrounding her with shadowy hands, threatening her and even cutting her face to show that he means business, and that he's observing her every move.\n\nAnd, somehow, Hawkeye manages to read his bluff and leaves safely. But she knows Pride is watching, even when telling Mustang about it, she speaks strictly in code, knowing that every shadow could be him...",

A fight which **will** take you a lot of time trying to whittle down its massive health (21K HP!) by exploiting the rare opportunities presented to you.\n\n*And* once you actually manage to whittle it down, there's a twist that all you managed to do is damage the outerside and all it takes is for it to cover up and regenerate its entire health in a few turns. It only takes a timely intervention from Gerson (an established, powerful warrior) and some thinking-outside-the-box to finally defeat it.\n\nKeep in mind that it's implied that it wasn't even fully hatched during the fight, so a full-on fight might just be downright impossible.\n\nEdit: Because I got a few comments stating that it isn't actually that hard, I came back to it and I have to agree. It isn't that hard; it's actually just pretty time-consuming. However, it still gives off a heavy air of hopelessness that instills in you the feeling that you aren't going to win and that if you don't beat it, the world *will* end.",

Maria cared for and loved him, always singing him a lullaby for bedtime, but George was a bit more distant, tho he still cared. But he was more interested in stealing the PSI knowledge of Giygas’ alien race and having humanity replicate it via technology to make it an innate ability for them too. The aliens didn’t like that, and swore to end humanity. Eventually, Giygas, now an adult, invaded Earth, using his unimaginable psychic power to control objects and people across the world. Maria, who was dead by that point, guided the protagonist Ninten (her great-grandson) and his friends after they helped her restless spirit in her Magicant remember who she is, and gave them her lullaby. Once they arrived at Giygas’ hideout, they couldn’t do anything to him, his power was unimaginable, and they were forced to sing Maria’s lullaby, which caused him emotional damage, which made him unable to fight, forcing him to flee and come back another time.\n\nThat was his role in MOTHER 1. Now we’re getting into MOTHER 2/EarthBound.\n\nWhat happened between the two games is unkown, but Giygas’ power and insanity appear to have spiraled into his body and mind exploding (literally), transforming him into a mindless dimension of darkness and the embodiment of evil itself. Giygas at this point feels nothing but pure agony and suffering, his power having become so vast that he consumed the entire universe and controls the time axis. Buzz Buzz, a psychic warrior from the future had to travel back in time to 10 years ago, to warn our hero Ness about the Universal Cosmic Destroyer, and to send him to his journey to absorb the power of the Earth and face Giygas. In the end of the game, Giygas, now in the Devil’s Machine, which was created to contain him and keep the last fragments of his sanity stable, travelled back into the ancient past before life existed, to plan the destruction of reality there. Ness and his friends had to travel back in time as well, now in robot bodies due to life not being able to survive time travel, to face him. Upon the end of the first phase of Giygas’ battle, his servant Porky Minch deactivates the Devil’s Machine, which unleashes Giygas’ true form, and is what you’re seeing in this gif.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jjfxwrgb4fff1.gif\n\nGiygas by this point is completely invulnerable and unhittable, his attacks also incomprehensible to even Ness, who’s mind became one with the universe. Only prayers were able to even just damage him, and Paula had to reach everyone across time and space with her telepathy so they’d pray for their safety against the embodiment of evil. But even by the end, those prayers were absorbed by him, the battle seemingly hopeless… until the real life player of the game starts praying for the heroes too. One prayer, two prayers, three prayers and a final fourth were enough to completely destroy the eldritch abomination and end his suffering and terror once and for all.\n\nGiygas was created to convey Shigesato Itoi’s (Creator of the MOTHER games) trauma of having seen what he believed was a rape scene as a child (It was actually just a brutal murder and dismemberment scene from the movie “The policemen and the dismembered beauty”) and a car accident where the victimised woman just whimpered that it hurt, it hurt, which was a line directly muttered by Giygas in his final battle. Giygas represents trauma and the loss of innocence, the latter a direct follow-up of Ness’ Magicant representing growing up and maturing.",

The problem is that is when he focuses, either stops playing or stops being emotional, and really shows how much the force loves him. Obi wan walked off knowing (1) it wasn’t his fight, (2) his job is taking care of the twins,and (3) if he goes for the kill there’s a high chance he’ll be the one to die. Cere pressed her luck, went for the kill, and died!<",

Strong, young lungs breathe in air laden with enemies turned into ashes. It is here that I thrive. I have toppled nations. I have slain kings. I have murdered legends. My name has been feared by warriors... and cursed by widows.” – General Grievous, The Clone Wars: The Dreams of General Grievous*\n\nGeneral Grievous inspired fear across the galaxy as the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems’ droid army. Always the strategist, Grievous made it a habit of escaping the clutches of the pursuing Jedi. Only after countless battles against Obi-Wan Kenobi, did Grievous’ ruthless warmongering for invading worlds and engaging Jedi in combat, come to an end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5qusrios40u11.jpg\n\n**Bringing General Grievous to Battlefront II**\n\nAs far as villains go, General Grievous, as seen in Star Wars™: Revenge of the Sith™, is one of the most complex that we’ve ever made for Star Wars™ Battlefront II.\n\nWhile he will make use of two lightsabers for his regular attacks, some of his abilities do bring his other two arms into play. Grievous coming towards you with four lightsabers swinging is a sight to behold, and one challenge that our animation team had to overcome.\n\nThere are few sights as chilling as the one of General Grievous scuttling across the floor on all six limbs. It’s not only a great way for him to escape a fight, but it’s also something that strikes a certain eerie fear into you as he approaches. You’ll get to experience this first hand with his Claw Rush ability.\n\nIt was hugely important to us that we captured the essence of General Grievous, ever the master tactician. Imposing up close, but also able to make a swift exit. We took inspiration from his appearances all across the Star Wars™ universe, most notably the movies and The Clone Wars Animated series.\n\nWho could forget the showdown between General Grievous and Obi-Wan Kenobi where the general used two rotating lightsabers? This scene from Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith would go on to serve as inspiration for his Unrelenting Advance ability and his appearance.\n\nIt would be amiss to talk about General Grievous without mentioning some of the iconic voice lines that he has available. Get ready to hear the hacking cough and, “You are a bold one,” among many other iconic lines. We went into detail on the voices of our heroes, General Grievous included, in a recent Community Transmission. Head on over here to read all about it.\n\nA challenging hero to create but one we’re incredibly excited to be welcoming into Star Wars Battlefront II. Let’s dive into his abilities, star cards, and more.\n\n**AbilitiesThrust Surge**\n\nGeneral Grievous focuses on a target in front of him and rushes to them while doing a stab motion with all 4 of his lightsabers.\n\n**Claw Rush**\n\nGeneral Grievous goes down on all 6 limbs and rushes forward, damaging and pushing away any enemies in his path.\n\n**Unrelenting Advance**\n\nGeneral Grievous spins two lightsabers over his head and can advance on his enemies. While this is active, Grievous blocks any frontal attacks and damages enemies in front of him.\n\n**Star Cards**\n\n* **Name:** Beating Heart\n* **Effects:** Increased Health Regeneration\n* **Description:** General Grievous has increased maximum health regeneration.\n\n* **Name:** Cyborg Rage\n* **Effects:** Health Regained\n* **Description:** Whenever General Grievous defeats an enemy trooper he regains 20 health. Whenever he defeats an enemy hero, he regains even more.\n\n* **Name:** Sith Trained\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage and Stamina Drain\n* **Description:** General Grievous deals extra damage with his lightsaber attacks but they drain more stamina.\n\n* **Name:** Jedi Killer\n* **Effects:** Increased Reach\n* **Description:** General Grievous can target enemies further when using Thrust Surge.\n\n* **Name:** Momentum\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage\n* **Description:** Thrust surge deals more damage to targets further than X meters.\n\n* **Name:** Cowardly Retreat\n* **Effects:** Damage Reduction\n* **Description:** General Grievous has more damage reduction while Claw Rush is active.\n\n* **Name:** Line up, Weaklings\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage\n* **Description:** After one enemy has been hit, Claw Rush deals more damage.\n\n* **Name:** Ceaseless Assault\n* **Effects:** Increased Active Time\n* **Description:** Unrelenting Advance can stay active for a longer period.\n\n* **Name:** Deadly Slashes\n* **Effects:** Increased Damage\n* **Description:** Unrelenting Advance deals more damage.\n\n**Voice Lines**There are a number of iconic voice lines that have been added for General Grievous, as well as some entirely new ones. A small selection of these are below:\n\n* “You are a bold one.”\n* “Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.”\n* “You must realise you are doomed.”\n* “I wield great power, Jedi fool.”\n* “The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here!”\n* “Make peace with the Force now, for this is your final outing.”\n* “Your screams are like music to my audio receptors.”\n* “The Kaleesh are not known for their mercy.”\n* “This will be easier than Dathomir.”\n* “A general welcomes all challengers.”\n* “(laughing) This calls for a celebration!”\n* “Now! Devastation tactics!”\n* “Do not cling to me like a dianoga! Attack!”\n* “Temper temper! You know where anger leads...”\n\nWe recently went live with a Community Transmission dedicated to Hero Voices, you can catch up on that [here](https://battlefront-forums.ea.com/discussion/121206/community-transmission-hero-voices-clone-wars).\n\n**Victory Poses**\n\n* Lines of Death\n* Jedi Hunt\n* Doom\n* Consider Yourself Crushed\n\n**Emotes**\n\n* “You are a bold one”\n* “Crush them”\n* “Surrender”\n* \"Your screams are music to my audio-receptors.\"\n\n**Milestones**\n\n* **Name:** Out of my Way\n* **Description:** Hit 30 Enemies with the Claw Rush ability\n* **Name:** Make them Suffer\n* **Description:** Defeat 30 Enemies with the Unrelenting Advance Ability\n* **Name:** Another one to the Collection\n* **Description:** Defeat 30 Enemies with the Thrust surge Ability\n* **Name:** Experienced General Grievous\n* **Description:** Earn 122,721 score as General Grievous\n* **Name:** Veteran General Grievous\n* **Description:** Earn 389,809 score as General Grievous\n\n**AppearancesJedi Hunter**The default appearance for General Grievous will be the Jedi Hunter. When you think of General Grievous, this will be the appearance that you are mostly likely to think of.\n\n**Battle Damaged**If General Grievous wasn’t feared enough, then his Battle Damaged visage will certainly invoke an additional sense of fear.\n\nThe Battle Damaged appearance will be classified as rare and cost 20,000 credits or 500 crystals.General Grievous will cost 35,000 credits and will not be purchasable for crystals. Remember to do your daily challenges and to log in each day for your daily crate reward!\n\nWe’ll be back in a few days’ time to talk about everything else that is due to arrive in the General Grievous Update on October 30.\n\n***Punch it***",

                    "text": "So this is less of a character build and more of some ideas to consider when playing.\n\n1. Attrition: Paladins, like actual Knights, are expensive and time consuming to train and maintain so any losses are much more keenly felt. As well, as an organization they have many more moving parts you can target that can cripple them/ Target their squires, their artisans, their farmers, their merchants and all the support network a sedentary existence requires and punish them when they overextend chasing you. Making the Paladins too cautious to leave their bases is as good a victory as crushing them in the fields. As well, as a Warforged, you can ignore pesky things like sleep or sustenance, meaning you can go far longer with less than they can.\n2. Most Paladins wear heavy armor: So, turn this against them, make them regret wearing 65 pounds of steel to fight you. Swimming would be damn near impossible, and chasing after you over large periods of time favors the lighter armored side. Fight in areas like swamps and mountainous/hilly areas to further press the advantage, bonus points for home town advantage. Otherwise, strike in the early morning or late at night when the paladins are no longer wearing heavy armor. Or, if the DM is particularly keen on realism, attack them on the march where the Paladins are less likely to be wearing armor. Armor is also expensive, and every suit lost is 1500 gold, 65 pounds and weeks of work lost.\n3. Fight Dirty: Honor and pride is for those with the strength to ignore the weaknesses it gives them, but they can also be bought with results. Paladins are bound and empowered by their oaths, make them break them. Force them to choose between pursuing you or helping those they've sworn to defend. Raid a village and leave it's inhabitants alive but gravely injured to force them to use their spell slots and lay on hands to heal them. Spread poison and disease to do the same, especially since they don't affect you as a warforged. Use feints and misdirection to split a greater force into smaller, more manageable ones, and never offer a head to head clash you are not 100% sure you can't win. Use traps, the environment, explosives, fire anything to give you an advantage. A paladin in a 10 foot pit with punji spikes is one more you don't have to deal with immediately, another pushed into a raging river will most likely drown before they can doff their armor. Also don't be too proud to run, killing one man is easier than a hundred after all. Maybe if you sneak into a camp, cause a stampede with their own warhorses, set fire to their food supplies, anything is fair game.\n4. Speaking of Fire: Fire is your best friend, because you know being a Warforged means you can destroy massive swathes of agriculture and forests with no real detriment to you. Causing a massive famine could lead to a peasant revolt against the paladins, burning down forests denies wood for weapons, tools and fuel. Even better, if there are elves living in any nearby forests, put on their armor and fly their banners to perform a false flag attack and burn down their forest to spark a war between the elves and the paladins.\n\nTL:DR life gets a lot easier for a martial character if you're willing to commit war crimes.",

Bugbears work well for this, particularly combined with Tavern Brawler: surprise the enemy use Long Arms and Tavern Brawler (or without TB at level 5) to grapple at 10ft range, then use your rapier and Grappler to continually sneak attack them. Monk's BA Dodge will help you evade most smites, though if you're able to disarm them of their weapon that'll shut down Smites as well.\nThat said, getting a Shatterspike Weapon on something like a Barbarian is also extremely viable: use your first attack to disarm instead of deal damage (As a non-BM manuever, this is typically contesting Athletics checks), then use your second attack to attack their dropped weapon. With Shatterspike's auto-crit and Barbarian's Brutal Critical, you're likely to destroy most weapons in one hit. From there, just go ham: they can no longer Smite without a weapon, so they just become tank meatsacks. \n\nAs for anti-Cleric, I'd still go grapple build, or any build that can prevent casting (Gagging the to prevent verbal components, the disarm build could work for casters that use foci, restraining to prevent somatic component spells, etc). Once they can't cast, most Clerics become easy pickings",

An Assassin 3 dip on a surprise round get a crit on all hits.

This also allows for strong defensive & offensive options with the runes. You can try to restrain the paladins, give them disadvantage as a reaction, or flat out force a re-roll. If there are multiple Paladins, you can even redirect attacks so they Smite eachother.\n\n+ a Barbian-Rogue combination can be very durable and be the best grappler/Strenght-checker there is. High durability is always great to have and the Paladin's biggest weakness is skill checks.\n\nBut overall I agree: Not using magic against magic-users is a tough match-up.",

And warlocks can get eldritch smite. Paladin features are similar to many other powerful features. So yes they are powerful, but not beyond what other classes are capable of. \n\nAnd I wouldnt say \"they can fill every conceivable role other than dex skills all at once\". They can deal tons of damage damage with smites, but that cost spells and actions that could be used to heal via cure wounds or lay on hands. They have to choose. That makes them very versatile but they cant do everything well all at once, as you claim they can. \n\nFlight/creatures that can stay out of smiting range is very frustrating to paladins. I would call that a weakness. No single d&d class is without a weakness or shortcoming. Some have multiple, some have only one or two, but they all have something. Also paladins have to maintain their oath. A DM can and should punish paladins who break their oath as the DM/the Paladin's god sees fit. This can limit roleplay choices which is frustrating, but are accepted when playing a paladin. \n\nAnd they are a popular multiclass, maybe even the most popular. I dont believe by the \"very, very large margin\" you claim, but they do get lots of love. This is not because they are broken in and of themselves, but they are very easy to make too powerful and thus break the game.

So this makes paladins prime targets for power gamers. \n\nIf you try to break the game, you can, and you can use paladins to break it, but that doesnt mean paladins themselves are broken.

Many classes get something to help them overcome status effects (like a monks stillness of mind). \n\nAura of vitality is nice for a paladins action economy but you have to wait 9 levels (I think??) To get it. By then the bard could've been using it and popping 5th levels while the cleric does +100 points of healing with mass cure wounds in one round, which pales the 70ish from aura of vitality over the course of 1 minute (assuming you maintain concentration). So yeah they can do some healing and damage, but they cant do both without taking some away from the other. A slot spent to use aura of vitality, takes away from smite damage.\n\nAnd this goes beyond just action economy. Its raw ability scores too. Paladins dont have 20s in everything. They still have that 8 in dex or intelligence. Even their wisdom and cha isn't that great if they want a super high str and con. They must pick and choose what to be good at at any point in time.  \n\nCompelled duel still has a save. A wisdom save. The 2nd most common in the game. I wouldnt count on that to solve all your problems. You have to get within 30 feet of them first, which means if they have melee allies nearby to hit you if you try running towards them or some barriers between you and them, then the paladin is screwed. And your 10 seconds of scrutiny didnt quite cover the issues with flying creatures. \n\nAnd I don't believe punishing a class because they make poor RP choices is at all wrong. Many classes have RP restrictions or guidelines to help direct the player. I do try to avoid it, because it is often frustrating, but most people agree to uphold those ideals because the class presented is the sort of character they want to play. Similar to how warlocks or clerics who defy their patrons may face consequences. Or rogues who get caught stealing face punishment by law. You can play in a world of absolute chaos where nobody takes responsibility for their actions and you can do whatever they want and that may be fun, albeit a little childish. But I tend to prefer games that have a great degree of verisimilitude. Where things are reasonable and make sense and reflect real life, while still letting magic and creativity flow. That's fun to me, you can play as you wish but our differences of opinion here does not refute the fact that flying and/or ranged creatures are the bane to a paladins existance.  \n\nSo there are weaknesses to paladins. Maybe if you thought for a bit longer than 10 seconds you would realize how weak your argument is. Rather than repeating the same banal platitudes everyone brings against paladins.",

The Age of Rebellion is still upon us, headlined by the return of Scarif in Supremacy, Co-Op and Instant Action.\n\nThe update releases on April 29 and we’ve got a lot to talk about, so let’s dive in with the details. \n\n[Age of Rebellion Supremacy & Instant Action](https://i.redd.it/bbu7fip9rkv41.gif)\n\nThe list of Supremacy planets for the Age of Rebellion is spearheaded by the return of Scarif, a planet we know you’re incredibly excited to venture back to. Joining Scarif will also be a series of iconic Age of Rebellion locations; Hoth, Death Star II, Tatooine, and Yavin 4.\n\nEach of these locations will also be arriving into Instant Action, making the Age of Rebellion Supremacy experience available offline as well as online. \n\n[Co-Op Updates](https://i.redd.it/w56s6kkcrkv41.gif)\n\nWe continue to see great feedback around Co-Op and it’s been wonderful watching the reactions, gameplay clips and reading your comments on the last update, which brought the game mode into the Age of Rebellion.\n\nFollowing on from that theme we’re adding Scarif to the list of available Age of Rebellion locations, and it will join all the existing locations in the map rotation.\n\nBack in January, we released both the MC85 Star Cruiser and Resurgent-Class Star Destroyer as part of the Supremacy setup for the Age of Resistance. The feedback we received on both of these Capital Ships was incredibly positive. As a result of this, we’ve made the decision to bring them to Co-Op as standalone locations.\n\nYou’ll find both the MC85 Star Cruiser and the Resurgent-Class Star Destroyer within the Age of Resistance map rotation.\n\nWith this update, we’ll be renaming Co-Op to Co-Op Missions. \n\n[Instant Action Missions](https://i.redd.it/lihibzifrkv41.gif)\n\nWith the positivity and reception surrounding Instant Action we’ve decided to expand it further, bringing a new option to offline play.\n\nInstant Action Missions are based around the Co-Op multiplayer experience, allowing you to play with 3 friendly AI allies and take on an enemy team made up of AI using our existing Co-Op Missions.\n\nFaction select will be possible, enabling both attack and defend gameplay options and the mode will be supported by every Co-Op location we have within the game, across all 3 eras. \n\n[Crait Heroes Vs. Villains](https://i.redd.it/sgdamj5irkv41.gif)\n\nHeroes Vs. Villains will be receiving a new planet in April, as the battle between dark and light reaches the salty mineral planet of Crait. This is one of our most requested HvV locations to date so it’s really exciting to be bringing it to the game mode.\n\nThe combat area will be focused inside the main hangar, with the blast doors open, letting in the sunset outside. \n\n[Trooper Appearances](https://i.redd.it/fsrqih3mrkv41.gif)\n\nWhen we announced that you would be returning to Scarif, one of the more prominent requests that we started to see surrounded the Shoretrooper appearances.\n\nWithin this update, we are pleased to confirm that troopers will have new appearances based on the Shoretrooper setup. Members of the Empire will have their Shoretrooper appearances, while the Rebellion will have access to their Pathfinder variants. \n\n[Hero Appearances](https://i.redd.it/gb7ijohorkv41.gif)\n\nWe know that many of you have been requesting new appearances for heroes (and villains) in the game, which is why we’ll be rounding out April with a selection of brand new ones.\n\nDarth Maul has been a hero who, in terms of new appearance requests, has consistently been one of the most prominent, which is why we’re incredibly excited to announce that he will have an appearance based on Star Wars Rebels available to him, complete with robotic legs. \n\n[Old Master Maul](https://i.redd.it/i7shj7rrrkv41.gif)\n\nBack in December, we brought three Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker™ appearances to the game, for Rey, Kylo Ren, and Finn. We’ve got two more on the way, and if you haven’t seen Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker™ yet, look away now! \n\n[Rey Skywalker](https://i.redd.it/dodwjm0urkv41.gif)\n\nThe first of these new appearances belong to Emperor Palpatine, and will be focused around his red robes. The second Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker appearance is based on Rey with her hood down, and with her new yellow lightsaber. We’re looking forward to bringing both of these frequently requested appearances to the game in April.  \n \n\n[Sith Eternal Palpatine](https://i.redd.it/9gx2xr0wrkv41.gif)\n\nWe also have a new appearance arriving for the dark side arriving in this month’s update, Kylo Ren with his hood up. \n\n[Damage Increase Messaging](https://preview.redd.it/1z7vg1fyrkv41.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=906d2bba6b7c2d8d098a8e6c62982f76471a449c)\n\nWe are adding in-game messaging for Damage Increase, and how it relates to damage decrease.\n\nYou can suffer a damage increase from two sources today: BB-8's Resistance Backing ability, and Dooku's Expose Weakness ability. Having a Damage Increase on yourself means that you take more than normal damage from any damage source.\n\nDamage Increase is messaged in-game in the same three elements as Damage Decrease:\n\nAbove Head: When looking at a friend or enemy, left of their health bar, an icon denoting damage increase will be shown for the duration of the effect\n\n* This icon is always red when looking at an enemy\n* You will only ever see the increase OR the decrease icon in this placement\n\nHit Indicator: When dealing damage to an enemy, the damage increase icon will animate out from your crosshair to denote that you dealt more than normal damage\n\n* This animation is always red\n* You will only ever see the increase OR the decrease animation\n\nPlayer Health: When looking at your own health bar at the bottom of your screen, icons will be shown to the left of your health number for the duration of any damage increase and/or damage decrease\n\n* You will see both the increase AND the decrease icon in this placement if you are affected by both simultaneously\n* The colors of these icons in this placement change to show the net effect:\n* You take more damage: Increase icon is red / Decrease icon is grey\n* You take less damage: Increase icon is grey / Decrease icon is yellow\n\n[Explosion Damage Reduction Redesign](https://preview.redd.it/nyslmhv1skv41.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=f513228d5925ca59f87eca46104786faba9b0f79)\n\nWe are removing the two cases in the game that would give you explosion damage reduction. This is done to ensure that our damage increase/decrease messaging is robust in all cases. We are also hoping that the redesign detailed below of the Bodyguard Star Card (which is largely unused by all Trooper classes) will make it more viable to bring into battle.\n\nThe BODYGUARD Star Card keeps its name but has a new description to reflect the new design. The gameplay effect changes to:\n\n* When at Critical Health (below 30%), you gain X% overall damage reduction\n* The amount of damage reduction scales with Star Card Rarity\n\nThe Critical Health Level is already messaged in-game by an audio filter and a red vignette, letting you know that you are in grave danger. The new design of the Bodyguard Star Card is meant to give you an increased chance of survival while in this state in certain situations.\n\nThe new gameplay effect means that some low/mid damage weapons will require 1 additional shot to kill an enemy that has Bodyguard equipped. As an example, it will take 7 instead of 6 body shots to kill a non-Heavy, and 8 instead of 7 body shots to kill a Heavy with Bodyguard equipped. The number of headshots from a default blaster to kill a non-Heavy and Heavy are unchanged.\n\nHigh damage weapons such as sniper rifles are largely unaffected as well. You can still kill a Trooper that has Bodyguard equipped with 1 headshot or 2 body shots with the NT-242 sniper rifle.\n\nAll examples above are made from the Epic Rarity of the Star Card, which is where the biggest effect kicks in. This damage reduction is only applied while below 30% health and is immediately removed when you go above that. For non-Heavy Troopers, this state is entered when below 45 health. For Heavy Troopers, the threshold is below 60 health.  \nFrom everyone on the Star Wars Battlefront II team, we thank you. Thank you for being a part of everything we’ve done, and for being the best community we could have asked for.\n\n***May the Force be with you. Always.*** \n\n[Release Notes](https://preview.redd.it/c589m8l5skv41.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=a799b4368697ba228932db87f641e31dcfd154b7)\n\n **FEATURES**\n\n* Scarif added as a new playable map on Co-Op Missions, Supremacy, Instant Action, Heroes Vs.

After launch I fully expected we'd see the already committed to TLJ update and then that would be it, EA would choose to just cut there losses and move on, instead we got 2 and a half years of new content, including a ton of fan requests. The game ended up been probably my favorite multiplayer title this gen, and I'm so thankful for everything DICE has done with the game.\n\nI hope some day down the road, we see DICE take another shot and we get a Battlefront 3, but reading some of the devs tweets (including Dennis) it seems like DICE is moving away from Star Wars in general with this. We can hope that maybe it's just they want some time on other things and they'll come back in a few years, but if not thank you to all the team at DICE and May the Force be with you, always.",

Sith Eternal Palp**: *Long have I waited.....*\n\n**3. Rey Skywalker**: I actually can't believe they did this. I was sure Lucasfilm would turn it down, but the crazy sons of bitches actually did it! I love the yellow saber, it's absolute glorious. Only problem is...\n\n**4. Hooded Rey**: Kind of weird that they made this a separate skin with the Skywalker Saber. Maybe its because she had the hood up on Ahch-To.\n\n**5. Rebels Maul**: Yessss! This will be my go-to Maul skin always because of the robot legs. It'll feel so immersive in Clone Wars battles.\n\n**6. Rebel Pathfinder**: cool skin. I hope it turns white on Hoth\n\n**7. Shoretroopers**: Okay, I knew this skin was coming. I was really hoping for literally any other Imperial skin, but we got this one. Makes sense considering Scarif and the large amount of people that wanted it, I'm just not ready to see them on Hoth.......\n\nI'm just one person though.

Regardless you guys have done a wonderful job bringing this game to the place it is now from where it was at launch and I hope to continue to be impressed with your work.

DICE has done an admirable job with BF2, but I'm sure Disney will have tough questions to ask about that whole shitty first 18 months the game had, and why, if they're doing so well now, why they couldn't have brought that earlier, and avoided the early missteps. There's also the fact that BF3 would be a next gen title and we don't know if that Frostbite update, if it happens, will lengthen development time.\n\nAn extreme and unlikely example that total moratorium on live service stuff may be, but based on past comments from Dennis and Ben suggesting that there is no appetite among gamers for a new Battlefront, and a heavy hint or two that Battlefront 3 wasn't at the time even in preliminary planning stages, I'd say EA is very likely to hedge its bets and let the afterglow of Battlefront II carry it through to the negotiations, with the Fallen Order series taking the lead in new release terms.",

            "text": "I just began reading Matt Stover's novelization of *Revenge of the SIth* and there's a great passage at the beginning about Grievous:\n\n>Palpatine is more than respected. He is loved.   \n>  \n>Even the rumor of his disappearance strikes a dagger to the heart of every friend of the Republic. Every one of them knows it in her heart, in his gut, in its very bones--  \n>  \n>Without Palpatine, the Republic will fall.  \n>  \n>And now confirmation comes through, and the news is worse than anyone could have imagined. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been captured by the Separatists -- and not just the Separatists.  \n>  \n>He's in the hands of General Grievous.  \n>  \n>Grievous is not like the other leaders of the Separatists. Nute Gunray is treacherous and venal, but he's Neimoidian: venality and treachery are expected, and in the Chancellor of the Trade Federation they're even virtues. Poggle the Lesser is Archduke of the weapons masters of Geonosis, where the war began: he is analytical and pitiless, but also pragmatic. Reasonable. The political heart of the Separatist Confederacy, Count Dooku, is known for his integrity, his principled stands against what he sees as corruption in the Senate. Though they believe he's wrong, many respect him for the courage of his mistaken convictions.  \n>  \n>These are hard beings. Dangerous beings. Ruthless and aggressive.  \n>  \n>General Grievous, though--  \n>  \n>Grievous is a ***monster***.  \n>  \n>The Separatist Supreme Commander is an **abomination of nature**, a fusion of flesh and droid -- and his droid parts have more compassion than what remains of his alien flesh. This half-living creature is a slaughterer of billions. Whole planets have burned at his command. He is the evil genius of the Confederacy. The architect of their atrocities.  \n>  \n>The author of their atrocities.\n\nNow that's some \\*chef's kiss\\* writing. Grievous's character design is monstrous and badass, along with the voicework done by Matthew Wood. A lot of us remember the battle at Hypori from the 2D Clone Wars, where he slaughters the Jedi Mystery Gang and it's played like a horror film. In fact, throughout most of that series has premium Grievous content, whether he's training in the Jedi Arts by Count Dooku, or leading the raid on Coruscant. \n\nMy question is, is there still room for that characterization in the current canon? His portrayal is consistent with how he is in Episode 3, but not necessarily with all the EU stuff I listed above. He oscillates between a truly deadly Jedi hunter and a coward in the 3D Clone Wars animated series. I would love to see more new Clone Wars content featuring many of those characters like Cad Bane, Mace Windu, etc., but maybe none moreso than General Grievous himself.",

In TFA, Hux was basically Kylo’s rival from within the FO. Hux had so much favor with Snoke that even Kylo dare not lay a finger on him. Given Kylo’s insane temperament and amount of power, that’s *serious.* And for the viewer, it’s a fun dynamic to see. Hux was cold, calculating, and vicious. He personally ordered a *massive* war crime that killed trillions of people, and when Starkiller began collapsing, Snoke made it clear that he wanted Hux off the base safely.\n\nNow, on to episode 8... *que Benny Hill theme* Hux is the butt end of “yo momma” jokes, and the victim of prank phone calls from Poe. He has no idea how to command the FO fleet and relies upon his generals to do it for him. He gets tossed around by Kylo like a rag doll. Yo, Rian Johnson, I’m no big fancy Hollywood executive, but making your antagonist double as the *comedic relief* is a *baaaad* idea. It totally retcons Hux’s character and deflates all tension and drama derived from the war in your movie called “Star Wars.”",

Who knows if Obi-Wan would have been able to beat him? Maybe such a power Greivous would have shifted the balance of power among the Septatists from Dooku to Greivous?

Lots of possibilities.\n\nBasically, while the older Greivous may have been “cool,” the current one makes far more sense from the perspective of everything that transpired during the Clone Wars is designed to bring Palpatine to power.

To do this you need competent people on both sides, the galaxy has to be pushed to the edge and the Jedi need to be threatened.\n\nOld Grievous did all of that, he wasn't some joke because Palpatine is competent enough to deal with people that aren't just idiots. He was exactly what the quote from the book said a monster to the wider galaxy and a threat because if he's a joke like TCW makes him his existence would literally be at risk everytime he comes up against a jedi. Instead you build someone who is capable of taking down all but the very best.\n\nThe idea Palpatine wouldnt allow there to be a Grievous that might defeat his future apprentice missed the point of the sith. It's trial by fire if he had a potential apprentice that Grievous could beat then they wouldnt be that great to begin with all sith are put in situations they can die from and the idea is always \"if you dont make it you weren't worth it anyway.\"\n\nDooku is also still above Grievous but this also goes into of TCW fails with that character to who used to be comparable to Yoda and Mace in legends(with Lucas actually saying in AotC in the force Dooku is equal to Yoda) so it was a big deal when Anakin beat him. Taking him down to someone Vos beats and is outsmarted by pirates is another terrible aspects of TCW because it mishandled almost all the villains and the separatists as a whole. They just lose. Every arc basically ends in a loss the way the show makes it seem is the Republic just wins basically every time rather than what the MMP showed the war to be an extreme back and forth that had competent people on both sides.",

The arrival of the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems’ droid army is imminent. General Grievous arrives into *Star Wars™* Battlefront II on October 30th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35w014mmfju11.jpg?width=3728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e97eddf23fa57bdc7ad65a4f4c0d4c3e4d66e57\n\n **General Grievous**  \nTrained in the Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself, you’ll be able to inspire fear in your enemies as you take control of the fearsome General Grievous.\n\nThe first time you use his Unrelenting Advance ability will certainly bring a smile to your face, as he equips all four lightsabers, with two spinning over his head, and towards his enemies.\n\nAs fearsome a warrior and tactician as General Grievous is, he’s also well known for some fan favourite quotes. With the likes of, “You are a bold one,” and, “Your screams are music to my audio-receptors,” arriving as emotes you’re not going to be short of options for unleashing a verbal barrage towards anyone in your way. It’s going to be a very nice moment when you’re engaged in combat with a Jedi and the voice line, “Temper, temper! You know where anger leads…” plays out.\n\nGeneral Grievous will cost 35,000 credits to purchase *(and will not be available via crystals)*. He will also come with an additional appearance, “Battle Damaged”, which will be classified as Rare and cost 20,000 credits or 500 crystals.\n\nLooking for more info on General Grievous, head over to the Community Transmission that details everything you need to know about the newest hero to enter the battlefront.\n\n**Squad System Improvements**  \nThe arrival last month of the Squad System has been well received amongst the community, and it’s reshaping the flow of battles across Galactic Assault.\n\nIn the Hotfix earlier this month, we made the change to restrict squad spawning to be Trooper-on-Trooper only. We’ve got additional changes coming next week, a lot of which was based on community feedback we’ve received.\n\nThe following rules will now be applied to the squad spawning system:\n\n* Troopers can spawn on Troopers\n* Troopers can spawn on Reinforcements\n* Troopers can spawn on Heroes (Exception being Boba Fett)\n* Reinforcements can spawn on Troopers\n* Reinforcements can spawn on Reinforcements\n* Reinforcements can spawn on Heroes (Exception being Boba Fett)\n* Heroes cannot spawn on anyone\n\n**Hero Health Star Cards**  \nWe will be replacing a selection of Hero Star Cards that have a very low usage and replace them with Health Star Cards. They will be broken up into two types of cards:\n\n***A generic “Health on Defeat” Star Card***  \nThis type of card is for Boba Fett, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, Kylo Ren, and Darth Maul. When a hero defeats an enemy, they will regain a small portion of health.\n\n***A “Defeat with Ability” card***  \nThis type of card is for Chewbacca, Yoda, Finn, and Captain Phasma. When using one of these Star Cards, health will only be awarded if a specific ability was used to defeat the enemy.\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback and are looking forward to bringing the new cards to the Battlefront that will make heroes more fun and engaging to play.\n\nYou can read more about the changes coming to Hero Health Star Cards by checking out this Community Transmission.\n\n**N-1 Starfighter**  \nThe N-1 Starfighter or “Naboo Starfighter” is often regarded as one of the most beautiful ships in Star Wars. One of the key bits of feedback we’ve received with regards to the N-1 is that you wanted more opportunities to fly it.  \nWithin the General Grievous Update, you’ll be able to show off your tricks as the N-1 arrives into Hero Starfighters as a grunt ship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7b98r03ufju11.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4be04d25ebf37792ad780f6e6bd0d26868388b9e\n\n**RELEASE NOTES**\n\n* General Grievous is now playable.

One alternative Battle-Damaged appearance is available to unlock.\n* The N-1 Starfighter has been added as a playable grunt ship on Hero Starfighters\n\n**QUALITY OF LIFE**\n\n* Certain Hero Star Cards have been reworked to allow for better Health regeneration for different Heroes\n* Added a HUD widget that displays the status of the player's Squad members next to the mini-map\n\n**HERO HEALTH STAR CARD CHANGES**  \n**BOBA FETT**\n\n* Old Star Card Name: Information Sharing\n* Old Star Card Effect: Reveal enemies to your allies for a part of its duration-\n* New Star Card Name: Bounty Claimed\n* New Star Card Description: Whenever Boba Fett defeats an enemy trooper, he regains twenty health.

It goes on just long enough that I got a chuckle out of it, mainly from one character with a beard and moustache also impersonating her. Idk why, just found that part of the bit funny. So fast forward, I finish episode 1, begin episode 2 and it begins with the attempted assassination of Padmé when her ship arrives. I'm thinking to myself, \"o ya this scene is actually pretty dark in the movie, how will they handle this?\" Well the ship blows up, Padmé runs up to the decoy Padmé and it's the same fucking moustached Lego guy. I fucking lost it.\n\nThis game has handled it's humor really weirdly tbh. Sometimes it's too childish and out of place, and sometimes it's almost too adult. I can't remember what part specifically made me think the latter, I'm still barely on EP 2 but ya the game is fucking wild so far.",

            "text": "Devils have always fascinated me; rather than wanton chaos and destruction, they’re embodiments of humanity giving in to the worst of their impulses and destroying themselves of their own volition. The Archdukes of the Nine Hells are the biggest players, offering a unique opportunity to DMs and players--an archdevil can serve as a patron for warlocks and other pact-makers, each embodying their own sinful theme.\r\n\r\nSo when looking for unique patron ideas to match a Warlock or an Infernal cult, look no further--below are profiles of **Zariel, Dispater,** and **Mammon**, the archdevils of the first three Circles of Hell. Zariel rules **Avernus,** a scorched battlefield at the center of the Blood War between devils and demons (mapping to **Wrath**). Dispater rules **Dis,** a endless city of pain and constant production (mapping to **Gluttony**). Mammon rules **Minauros,** a city of cheapskates crumbling into a swamp (mapping to **Greed**). Each offers role-playing opportunities, an expanded spell list, and a brief history to help bring your Nine Hells to life.\r\n\r\nThese profiles are excerpts from **The Codex Infernal,** a collection of worldbuilding and gameplay options to bring the Nine Hells into your game. [You can read more about the project on my blog,](https://aravar27.wordpress.com/2021/03/13/the-codex-infernal-a-full-fledged-guide-to-the-hells/) where you can also find statblocks and art for the archdevils released so far.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Zariel, Archduke of Avernus, Lord of the First\r\n\r\n> *Philosophers and poets argue about the definition of charisma: whether it means someone is beautiful or well-spoken, refined or relatable. The Archduke of Avernus would put that debate to rest by slaughtering every fool involved.*\r\n\r\n> *When Zariel speaks, you listen. When she gives an order, you comply. What happens if you don't? Honestly, I'm not sure. The thought never even crossed my mind.*\r\n\r\n### The Lady of Wrath\r\nZariel was an angel of Celestia, assigned to watch and report on the Blood War’s developments for the gods. But as the centuries wore on, she grew tired of the stalled fighting and repeated stalemates; it was bloodshed without purpose, war without end. So she took matters in her own hands: flying at the head of her Hellriders, Zariel charged into the Lower Planes to cleanse the world of all fiends--devil and demon alike--permanently.\r\n\r\nUltimately the mission failed, with the Hellriders slaughtered and Zariel grievously wounded. She was captured and brought to Nessus, the Ninth Circle; the domain of Asmodeus himself. When she awoke, Zariel expected to be tortured. To her surprise, the Lord of the Nine offered her a job.\r\n\r\n### She Who Destroys\r\nAs overseer of the Infernal Legion, Zariel commands thousands of devils across the vast plains Avernus and the River Styx. She feels no guilt for throwing away the lives of these soldiers--they, too, are fiends and sinners born to die for her cause. Through sheer force, she has managed to push the demonic forces away from the Hells, ravaging the once-functioning cities of Avernus in the process. Now Zariel finds herself at a standstill, unable to permanently destroy the endless hordes of the Abyss.\r\n\r\n## Playing Zariel\r\n\r\n**Appearance.** Zariel's form is that of a fallen angel; pale, glowing skin with black wings and hollow eyes; her hair burned away by the halo of flame wreathed about her head. She wears the armor of a general, carrying a dark blade on her hip and wrath in her eyes.\r\n\r\n**Personality.** Zariel is, above all, a brilliant soldier who leads from the front. As commander of the Infernal Legion, she has mastery of battlefield tactics, wartime logistics, and rallying troops to battle.\r\n\r\nBeneath the surface of her military demeanor is a seething rage: a bottomless hatred for demonkind that colors her every decision. Zariel makes no secret of her wrathful nature, which makes many hesitate to associate with her. On the other hand, her goals and expectations are clear: those who fight well will be rewarded. Those who fail will be destroyed.\r\n\r\n**As Patron.** Zariel is the patron of warriors and those who bear a violent vendetta. By grooming mortal champions in life, she can recruit them for her armies in death. Warlocks who serve Zariel well are practically guaranteed high positions in the Blood War--where the true battle begins.\r\n\r\n##### Zariel Expanded Spell List\r\n\r\n| Spell Level  | Spells |\r\n|:---:|:-----------|\r\n|  1st  | ***inflict wounds, searing smite*** |\r\n|  2nd  | ***branding smite, flame blade*** |\r\n|  3rd  | ***blinding smite, fireball*** |\r\n|  4th  | ***staggering smite, wall of fire*** |\r\n|  5th  | ***banishing smite, destructive wave*** |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Dispater, Archduke of Dis, Lord of the Second\r\n\r\n> *\"The others call me paranoid. Is it paranoid to bind oneself within a suit of indestructible armor? Is it folly to protect one's tower with every defense known? Is it insane to pursue every last secret of this cruel universe so as to overcome the fickle twists of fate and fortune?\"*\r\n\r\n> *\"Uh...\" I hesitated. \"...No?\"*\r\n\r\n> *\"Of course,\" Dispater murmured. \"That's precisely what an assassin* ***would*** *say...\"*\r\n\r\n### The Iron Administrator\r\n\r\nDispater was one of the angels who stood by Asmodeus' side when the devils first fell from grace. While Asmodeus acted recklessly, Dispater urged caution; while Asmodeus made bold military maneuvers, Dispater provided the supplies to keep the armies from crumbling.\r\n\r\nAs Lord of Dis, Dispater has continued to prove his competence one thousandfold. Ruling from his Iron Tower, Dispater's careful, clever leadership has allowed Dis to flourish into the most stable location in the Nine Hells. As the Blood War progressed, Dispater realized the importance of arms and armor production, and has since turned Dis into a weapons manufactury to supply the Blood War and battles across the multiverse.\r\n\r\nBut over the years, Dispater has lost his sense of perspective. His caution has given way to paranoia; he obsesses over maximizing productivity, and protecting himself from harm, desperately seeking to uncover every secret of the universe so that he can never be surprised.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Playing Dispater\r\n\r\n**Appearance.** Despite his internal turmoil, Dispater appears as a handsome, dark-haired devil in finely-woven robes. Recently, he has built himself a suit of adamantine armor, enchanted with powerful defenses that leave him practically untouchable. He wears this armor at all times as he rules from his Iron Tower, perpetually wary of incoming attacks.\r\n\r\n**Personality.** Though he coats his scheming under the guise of a competent, benevolent ruler, the reality is that Dispater trusts nothing and nobody. His remarkable intelligence allows him to quickly understand how to take advantage of any situation--but he quickly grows obsessed, hoping to maximize his benefit and minimize the cost. This combination of erratic paranoia and raw intellect makes Dispater a deadly figure to anybody he sees as a threat.\r\n\r\n**As Patron.** Dispater seeks out warlocks with obsessions as severe as his own--whether for food, safety, information, or something else he can provide. His limitless ability to produce things means that he can stoke and feed these obsessions, all the while using his minions to gather information and feed his numerous plots and schemes.\r\n\r\nDispater keeps all servants at an arm's length, terrified of betrayal and pretending to keep out of his warlocks' affairs. In truth, he carefully monitors their work, taking great pains to ensure that his minions follow his commands.\r\n\r\n##### Dispater Expanded Spell List\r\n\r\n| Spell Level  | Spells |\r\n|:---:|:-----------|\r\n|  1st  | ***absorb elements, shield*** |\r\n|  2nd  | ***detect thoughts, see invisibility*** |\r\n|  3rd  | ***nondetection, tongues*** |\r\n|  4th  | ***arcane eye, death ward*** |\r\n|  5th  | ***hallow, scrying*** |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Mammon, Archduke of Minauros, Lord of the Third\r\n\r\n> *\"Make yourself indispensable,\" he said, \"and it won't matter one bit whether you are loved or feared.\" Mammon leaned forward, his eyes suddenly serpentine slits. \"Now, boy, time is money. So I suggest that we come to a deal that makes me money--or you'll learn what happens to those who waste my time.”*\r\n\r\n### Mammon, the Miser\r\nMammon is the two-faced, sharp-minded ruler of Minauros, infamous for his boundless greed. Some mistrust his avarice, believing it to be an affront to the noble cause of devilkind. Others respect his bare-faced desire for money, since it makes Mammon’s motivations clear as day. Everyone despises him for his unpleasant demeanor and sense of relentless entitlement.\r\n\r\nMammon was one of Asmodeus' original angels in the founding days of the Hells; a quartermaster in the celestial armies, he was swayed by Asmodeus' promise of wealth and prosperity as a result of endless war. Asmodeus fed into Mammon's desires with gold, turning his once-ally into a hoarder and miser obsessed with flooding his own coffers.\r\n\r\n### The Impossible Empire\r\nMammon is, quite literally, irreplaceable. Although Minauros is collapsing because of his obsessive need to cut corners, the archdevil is a financial genius and an expert at keeping the Blood War funded. It's only through Mammon's machinations that Asmodeus can afford to pay for Zariel’s war strategy while still funding his own schemes across the planes. Mammon uses a combination of honeyed words, underhanded tactics, and overt threats to stockpile more wealth than any creature alive, manipulating investors by appealing to their hunger for profit.\r\n\r\nWith so much money, many have wondered whether Mammon will one day grow bold enough to challenge Asmodeus himself. So far, he has expressed no desire to challenge his old friend for the throne--it's just not profitable enough.\r\n\r\n## Playing Mammon\r\n\r\n**Appearance.** When trying to appear respectable, Mammon prefers the form of a large pit fiend, sharply dressed in a bespoke suit. When alone or among fiends, Mammon's true form takes the form of a large, gold-scaled snake that coils around his riches, hungering for wealth.\r\n\r\n**Personality.** To Mammon, all things can be measured by their value in coin; each plan, soul, and action is weighed in terms of its overall monetary benefit. When acting against his enemies, Mammon rarely makes things personal--to him, it's all business. But beneath the refined facade lies a dangerous temper: the archdevil can't stand when circumstances don't go his way. \r\n\r\n**As Patron.** Mammon is the patron of those who seek wealth, fame, and monetary success. He can make his servants rich by offering business tips, valuable powers, and the threat of force when necessary. The relationship is emotionless and transactional--unless the mortal does something to personally insult the archdevil himself. \r\n\r\nIn return, Mammon gets a high rate of return on his investments, manipulating the world so that his coffers grow fuller. The actions of his subordinates tend to benefit him both directly *and* indirectly--and on his best days, he can even snag a few souls along the way.\r\n\r\n##### Mammon Expanded Spell List \r\n\r\n| Spell Level  | Spells |\r\n|:---:|:-----------|\r\n|  1st  | ***detect magic, floating disk*** |\r\n|  2nd  | ***arcane lock, locate object*** |\r\n|  3rd  | ***clairvoyance, glyph of warding*** |\r\n|  4th  | ***secret chest, private sanctum*** |\r\n|  5th  | ***animate objects, passwall*** |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and I hope this is helpful for your games!

Players often confuse demons and devils if they don't see these creatures frequently, a common person would not even know that there is a distinction between those two.  They might know about devil contract and a name or two about damned beings from hell, but that's about it.\n\nOf course, this is heavily dependent on the world and the NPC position in it. Some setting might have knowledge of planes being taught on schools, while in other a archmage might think that there is only the prime material. But in general: \n\nPeasants know no more than a tradition or supersticion, which might be false anyway, its a warning and something parent pass  to kid, not a defined in stone fact that they need to know, like when to harvest wheat.\n\nWell taught npcs and minor scholar might know about their existence, or a thing or two. If they aren't involved with it directly (being in a Cult of Asmodeus, living in a drow society, serving under a wizard who study the lower planes, etc) they might disregard it, ot be unaware of how accurate their info is.\n\nPowerfull individuals who deal with magic, such as archmages, leader of cults or the protector of a region whom had problem with incursions in the past are generally more aware and interested in learning about those things, as it affect them directly. They should have more reliable information, but still, not a complete understanding of all the inner politics of Baator, this would fit only some truly out of the curve individuals, such as Mordenkainen, Elminster or Tasha. \n\n\nOn a side note, Baator is filled with lies over loes that Asmodeus let be spread, because it protects them, making they seem weaker than they are, and leading armies to their doom, or stronger, instilling fear on their enemies. Because of that, even cultists are probable victims of this web of lies. Just because they adore and/or study devils, doesn't mean they are learning the right things.\n\nEdit: Mordenkainen tome of Foes give us 2 examples of lies (or they are true?) regarding duke Bael, one of the closest allies of Mammon. In its stat block, Mordenkainen affirms that Bael has cults that worship him as the true Lord of Hell, and some sources claim that it was him who gave the Invisibility spell to mankind. Similarly, the 2nd in command of Cania, 8th layer of Hell, Hutijin is said to be a obscure name, as he hates mortals, but that other devils spread the ways to summon him in an attempt to mess with Mephistopheles",

With those added, here’s my list of the Archdukes of Hell and their respective sins\n\n\n1 - Zariel - Wrath. Pretty self explanatory.\n\n\n2 - Dispater - Control. Dispater needs everything to go exactly his way, and he’s built one of the biggest cities in the planes to exert his perfectionist tyranny.\n\n\n3 - Mammon - Greed. Enough said.\n\n\n4 - Fierna / Belial- Lust. Fierna is more concerned with emotional manipulation while Belial is more concerned with sexual taboo.\n\n\n5 - Levistus - Gluttony. This one was tough, but based on the definition of gluttony as over-consumption I think it fits. In Levistus’s attempts to overthrow Asmodeus, he didn’t just want his throne, he wanted everything, including Asmodeus’s consort Bensozia. Levistus murdered Bensozia, while attempting to force himself on her. Levistus’s desire to completely own and dominate everything, to never be satisfied, made gluttony a good fit.\n\n\n6 - Glasya - Envy. “Of course I love my father, without him, who could I strive against?” Glasya greatly desires to inherit her father’s throne and depose him.\n\n\n7 -  Baalzebul - Sloth. Since his failed rebellion against Asmodeus, Baalzebul has been locked into a supernatural curse of apathy, allowing his schemes and realm alike to deteriorate into sludge.\n\n\n8 - Mephistopheles - Pride. Mephistopheles is easily the most arrogant being in the Nine Hells. He has had multiple chances to overthrow Asmodeus by allying with other archdukes, but he refuses to do so, believing that he alone is worthy of deposing the King of Hell.\n\n\n9 - Asmodeus - Deception. The Father of Lies, Author of the Pact Primeval, and the only being clever enough to remain on top of the vipers’ nest that is Hell.",

            "text": "&nbsp;\n\nI will never forget the time a human taught Spatial Physics in university. Mr. Crank had been a last minute hire when the previous professor suffered a mental breakdown when he went over a new FTL engine design. That was a little odd, but he had been getting on in his years and it was not an uncommon thing to happen among the elderly staff. I *was* quite surprised the Dean managed to find someone on such short notice; Spatial Physics professors are not as common as one might think.\n\nThe change was welcome since Professor 268 had been notoriously boring. Even more boring than Professor 267- and they were clones! Getting a 'human' professor when they were only just being inducted into the Federation was a bonus; everyone was interested in what he looked like. I remember hoping that I would not get distracted with his appearance and focus on the material. What a naive fool I was...\n\nWeek one was originally scheduled to be the usual introduction, but the syllabus netpage for the course had been changed to say \"unorthodox introduction.\" That right there should have been enough to warn us something was amiss but since the Dean must have seen and approved the change we had no cause for alarm. Everyone was intrigued. Anything new, be it scholarly or otherwise, was cause for excitement. Week one had had the same structure for millennia. \n\nEveryone arrived at the lecture dome an hour early in anticipation. Plazbands were checked with increasing frequency as the scheduled start of class drew near. Anxious mutterings carried easily in the acoustically perfect room. Tension was at its peak when, precisely on time, Mr. Crank climbed in through the window.\n\nOn the fourth floor.\n\n\"What?\" he said defensively to a room full of astonished faces, \"It's faster this way.\"\n\n\"It's faster to scale the building than take the ramp?\" the student closest to him asked.\n\n\"'Course it is,\" he answered, slightly irritated, \"Those ramps that take forever to get up. Climbing in this weak crap you call gravity is easy.\"\n\nNo one knew what to say to that. What did you expect? No one had ever climbed the Great Tree of Knowledge from the *outside*; that was what the helix ramp was for! \n\nHe strode over to the center of the room and flicked off the holo-projector that had been ready for his presentation. \"Today you will be getting a hands-on introduction to spatial physics, so pack up and meet me at landing platform 11.\"\n\n\"Meet you there? You mean you aren't coming with us?\" another student asked.\n\n\"Hell no,\" he said, striding back over to the window and throwing a leg over the edge, \"I'm not setting foot in that godawful spiral if I can help it.\"\n\n\"But that's on the 11th fl-\"\n\nThe window closed and the human leapt up to an adjacent branch with incredible ease. In no time at all he was gone; only the rustling of foliage marked his passing. There was a rush for everyone to gather our things and leave; we wanted to see how fast Mr. Crank could climb and no one wanted to miss it.\n\n-\n\nHalf an hour later, we found him waiting next to an orbital shuttle and tapping his foot for some reason. I suspected he was impatient because he'd had enough time to rest from the climb. He hustled everyone on board and banged a strong fist against the hull. Our confusion was only momentary as the pilot apparently knew that was clearance for takeoff. He didn't even sit down. Leaning against the airlock was apparently enough for to him to remain secure.\n\n\"Alright. Everyone suit up and meet me outside,\" he said when we filed out onto the transit station in orbit.\n\n\"Outside?\" a student asked, \"What do you mean 'outside'?\"\n\n\"Outside, as in out the airlock. We're going to be inspecting the ship I took to get here.\"\n\n*That* was interesting. So far as anyone could remember, spatial physics had always been a theoretical class. As odd as this was, no one wanted to miss seeing the ship that carried the odd human here. It took awhile to get all 40 of us in protective hardsuits and even longer to cycle the airlock in groups of four.\n\nThe human ship was... strange. Really, that's about the most accurate description anyone could come up with. It was a ship in the sense that it was metal and had an airlock. Beyond that, it looked like half an oval with an elongated nose and three wide fins just before the back end. No engine pontoons, no warp spines, no grand multi-deck frame, and no wide observation clusters for curious passengers. Nothing at all like a standard Federation ship design of any sort. The best that could be said was that it was half a ship.\n\nMr. Crank had us engage our magnetic boots and walk over the surface of the hull to 'get a feel for her', whatever that meant. He was so excited to get to the engine and actually disengaged his mag boots to leap off the hull -*without a tether*- and onto the dorsal fin just to get there faster. I was certain that if sticking to the hull was not absolutely essential, he would be bouncing up and down on the engine manifold. \n\nThis was alarming for two reasons. \n\n1) Standing, let alone *bouncing* on an FTL engine, is universally a BAD thing. \n\n2) It was a simple concave half-sphere with a small hole in the center. Just looking at the alien construct provoked a deep sense of unease. Where were the field-focusing rings?! How was the ship supposed to maintain structural integrity without the stabilizer module?! This thing looked like an engine bell for a reaction drive; who even uses those?!\n\n\"This is it!\" he exclaimed proudly, \"This is the engine I designed and built with my own two hands. Apparently it's nothing like what the Federation uses so this is going to be an interesting class indeed!\"\n\n\"Mr. Crank?\" someone asked, \"What do you mean it's 'nothing like' what we use? FTL engines have been standard for millennia.\"\n\n\"Standard is boring!\" he admonished, \"Space is supposed to be exciting- a place of limitless potential! I was so badly disappointed to see such a horrible lack of imagination that I just **had** to build it! You need something to reignite that spark of creativity! Besides, my engine is twice as fast as the Federation-approved *'standard'* FTL tech.\"\n\nThat floored us. *Twice* as fast? Unbelievable!\n\n\"How is that even possible?!\" someone else asked.\n\nMr. Crank scratched his helmet for some reason. \"Ehh, that's a bit tricky to explain in a lecture. Which is why we're here! You really have to experience it to understand. Feeling it happen doesn't come across in the equations.\"\n\n\n\"So when you say 'hands-on', what you really mean is-\"\n\nMr. Crank gave us a happy grin. \"Yup, we're gonna take this baby out for a spin!\"\n\n\"Hey Arnold,\" he said, banging a gloved fist on the hull, \"hit it!\"\n\nThroughout all of this ridiculousness, none of us had noticed the ship had detached from the station and drifted clear of it. We felt a rumble through our feet as unknown processes began to exert their power on the ship. Before panic really set in, we jumped.\n\nI say 'jumped' because that's what it felt like. The entire ship leapt beneath us. One minute we were in the black void of space, the next we were Somewhere Else.\n\nAll around us was a blue, faintly glowing barrier and outside of that thin barrier was Chaos. The fiery tempest that raged outside our thin shield fit the name perfectly. It was as if the universe was furious at us for daring to break the rules and trying its absolute hardest to kill us all. The longer we traveled, the more ferocious it became until the barrier began to bulge inwards from the aft and flames shoot up around us. Cries of terror came from everyone as the Chaos of nature came closer to rectifying this abomination of a ship and killing all the blasphemous idiots stupid enough to be on it.\n\n\"Beautiful, isn't it?\" Mr. Crank shouted over us, apparently admiring the impending Doom, \"Right now we're plowing through a dimension that is, as best I can tell, comprised entirely out of antimatter! The ship releases ground-up bits of slag and shapes the shockwave of annihilating matter behind us to push the ship forward- cheap *and* efficient! You can get from one end of the galaxy to the other with a few kilos of slag-dust, no problem!\"\n\n\"And that shield is all that separates us from total destruction?!\" I screamed.\n\n\"You got it!\" he said happily, \"But don't worry about it failing; our electromagnetic field projector is super awesome. That bulging means we're at top speed now.\"\n\n'Super awesome'. That's how he described the only thing keeping us alive.\n\n\"Trust me, I'm an engineer!\"\n\nAs an engineer, that was not reassuring.\n\nNow I understood what had happened. Professor 268 must have looked at the design of this engine and gone mad at the fact that anyone would even **think** of such an insane concept, let alone *build* one! The Dean probably saw the document he was reviewing as proof enough that this crazy human knew what he was about. That was how a replacement was found so quickly. Brand new form of FTL engine twice as fast as standard? What tremendous prestige the inventor would bring to the university if he were to teach! \n\nGods. The bane of every serious branch of engineering is an administrator who doesn't understand the basics. This madness could have been avoided before anyone tempted fate. \n\nI hadn't noticed until now, but my vision had been getting increasingly stroboscopic. I had taken the pulsing light to be the regular explosions hurling us forward. Now *everything* was throbbing. I felt the titanic power of, I assumed, the external combustion engine in my bones.\n\n\"You may be experiencing some meta-turbulence at the moment,\" Mr. Crank said in what I'm sure he thought was a reassuring tone, \"That's completely normal and harmless so long as you don't move around too fast, otherwise you get an uncomfortable case of space-sickness. Please keep your limbs at your sides and remain in an upright position for the remainder of the flight.\"\n\nActually, that was pretty reassuring.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention,\" he added, \"Don't worry about radiation; I'm pretty sure it's been fixed.\"\n\nHe must have seen our horrified expressions so he hastily added, \"I mean I had the shields tuned so that you won't get blinded by the gamma radiation reflecting off them. The opacity was off by %4.61 a few days ago. You wouldn't believe the headache that gave me.\"\n\nBy this point all of us were frozen in terror and fervently wishing it would be over soon. Many of us were prepared to go straight to the Dean and demand (before her resignation, that is) that Mr. Crank be arrested, or- or something! No one would ever use such a ludicrously dangerous engine, no matter how fast it went. Federation FTL drives have been the safe standard for thousands of years and I'd be damned if I didn't make sure it stayed that way. Proven technology and methods had absolutely **no need whatsoever** to change if they worked perfectly. I couldn't wait to set foot on solid ground and spend the rest of my life safely on the comfort of my home world. \n\nAs crazy as Mr. Crank seemed, he probably took into account our stress levels because we Dropped out of Chaos and back into the relative comfort of the black void of realspace. I was so relieved to be 'home' that the plummeting sensation of dropping was reduced to a tugging sensation in my stomach. It was the jarring *lurch* backwards that drove the air from my lungs and threatened to yank my eyeballs out of my skull. \n\nAs soon as we had our breath back, all of us began shouting at Mr. Crank. At first we didn't notice that we had stopped near a particularly beautiful gas giant and a moon in the early stages of being colonized. \n\nHere, the human's energetic self became sombre almost immediately. He stared at the spectacular view of the giant's rings in the background and the colony in the fore. He seemed melancholy at the sight. The change was so striking that our protests faltered and died. He was about to say something, hesitated for a second, then spoke over the group channel.\n\n\"I'm not sure you would understand the multitude of fascinating alien things my species imagined in the thousands of years we spent looking to the heavens. My ancestors started off as nomadic tribes and spread across the world on foot. They were fascinated by the stars, creating myths and legends of origins, gods and warriors. A field of study attributing the movements of planets and stars to natural phenomena and events in our lives were the center of religions, superstition, and pseudoscience. It grew more refined and complex for thousands of years. So much importance was given to the movement of heavenly objects that it determined the fate of entire nations, changing and guiding the course of history. Eventually our explorers used them to navigate the huge, treacherous oceans and sail to new lands. \n\n\"The things they saw always drove them to seek the unknown; to find the final frontier and go where no man has gone before. In the span of a few thousand years, we had explored everywhere we could physically go. Then we started looking up again- this time with purpose. The endless sky of brightly shining stars among the void, the points of light to which we had given so much poetic meaning, were open to us now. Less than a hundred years after the first aircraft flew, we could finally escape the bonds of gravity and leave our world.\"\n\nThat startling fact explained a few things.\n\n\"In the early stages of human space exploration all we had accomplished was a few visits to Earth's moon and launching some robotic probes. It took **35 years** for *Voyager 1* to be the first spacecraft to leave the heliosphere of our solar system. Despite how paltry those accomplishments sound, to us it was a huge deal. We humans are only just now spreading our wings to explore those far off places of our dreams.\"\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder at us. \"Maybe you'll understand where I'm coming from after you listen to the words of Carl Sagan, the man who inspired me to become who I am today.\"\n\nMr. Crank lifted his arm and entered a command on the control pad. On all of our visors, a grainy, long-distance image of  a single blue pixel amid a thin band of light appeared. [A voice began to narrate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PN5JJDh78I)\n\n\n*“From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines. Every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there- on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.\"*\n\nImages of humans were shown living and laughing, playing and dancing. Important historical figures gave speeches to inspire and incite. The brief snapshot of diversity lent a small bit of significance to the dot.\n\n*\"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in Glory and Triumph, they could become the momentary masters... of a fraction... of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how* fervent *their hatreds.*\n\nArmies clashed, soldiers marched, bombs dropped and destruction wreaked upon their fellows. Suicidal strikes, vast navies, cannons and explosions. Faces of humans in various colors and ages flickered just as briefly as an atomic weapon detonates.\n\n*\"Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.\"*\n\nReligious figures and devotees preach and worship a higher purpose and power- all of it rendered insignificant in the void.\n\n*\"The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit? Yes. Settle? Not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand.\"*\n\nThe dark side of Earth turns until the sun rises over the horizon, illuminating the blue world.\n\n*\"It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”*\n\nEarth quickly began to recede and then vanish as the camera flew away from it and out of the star system. Before long, even Sol was lost among the multitude of stars. As the scale of space continued to expand beyond our ken, we pondered what we had heard.\n\nTo have lived their entire lives doubting there was any life besides on Earth was a frightening and terribly lonely thing. It was no wonder they fought so violently between themselves. There was only so much space for them to share and a diverse species like humans were bound to have conflicting ideologies. \n\nTo reach a point where knowledge of the universe becomes widespread and the technology to search for others that lived in it only to find nothing? That sad, bleak prospect must have given the loneliness and isolation felt when contemplating the distance between stars an even greater magnitude.\n\nAdd the image of that dot and that loneliness was further magnified, acquiring an element of fear from the unimaginably vast void of nothingness their tiny world -a lonely, minuscule oasis of life and safe haven- floated in. It was truly humbling. \n\n\"That was the position we were in,\" Mr. Crank said quietly, looking up at the stars, \"With such conflict and strife everywhere, with the limitations we were under, the only way we had to escape solitary confinement was to use our imaginations to invent people and places and things that *could* exist. \n\n\"Multitudes of stories were told about them. Writers spent centuries inventing fictional technologies that eventually, for some, became real. They pushed the boundaries to the edges of the universe and beyond with their tales. Multiverses, parallel worlds, and alternate dimensions were explored in our minds. All we had to go on was what our telescopes and handful of probes could show us. With the limitations of lightspeed, all we could see was the past.\n\n\"Technology at the time limited us to extremely dangerous, expensive, and slow methods. Physicists struggled to come up with a way to travel faster than light even as we made plans to colonize our closest habitable planet with primitive chemical rockets. We had a myriad of our own problems on Earth that meant very small budgets for space exploration. Missions were planned on multi-decade timescales due to material and funding constraints and many of them died in bureaucratic triage.\"\n\nSuch enormous obstacles to overcome simply to establish a single colony was inconceivable to me. Chemical rockets? The expense must have been obscene, given how weak he thought our gravity was. The prospect of riding a bomb as the only way to escape their planet made my limbs quake in fear.\n\n\"But that didn't stop us. The words of Sagan inspired as well as humbled. He was the one who gave millions hope and caused people to reach for the stars. Those words created a generation of people like me. They fueled our desire to travel into the great unknown and sate our curiosity. Limitless imagination was our lure. We would always be looking for what mysterious marvels we thought might be out there.\n\n\"And you?\" He lowered his gaze to the ship he stood on and shook his head in disappointment, hands on his hips. \"You have long since lost the sense of wonder and curiosity that your forefathers had when they first traveled the stars. When I saw how stagnant the Federation had become, how lackluster your general view of the universe is, how distant you were from your roots, I knew I had to do something drastic. *That* is why I built my engine. *That* is why I came to teach. *That* is why I brought you out here the way I did. I needed to shock the half-dead heart of the Federation and get it beating again.\n\n\"If you still don't understand, listen carefully to the words that fed our insatiable curiosity,\" he said, tapping at the display once more, \"Try and put yourselves [in our place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH3c1QZzRK4)\"\n\nThe screen goes black, and a statement that the following video is recreations of the human's own star system prefaces the video. It begins with a view from the surface of Earth, panning up to the starry night sky.\n\n*\"For all it's material advantages, the sedentary life has left us... edgy. Unfulfilled. Even after four generations in villages and cities, we haven't forgotten. The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.*\n\nA primitive ship relying on centrifugal methods of gravity leaves Earth orbit. Then, as massive cargo bay doors open, a single human drifting inside is treated to a spectacular view of a massive, swirling red storm on the surface of a planet.\n\n*\"We invest far off places with a certain... romance. The appeal, I suspect, has been meticulously crafted by natural selection as an essential element in our survival. Long summers, mild winters, rich harvests, plentiful game- none of them lasts forever. Your own life, or your band's, or even your species, might be owed to a restless few- drawn, by a feeling they can hardly articulate or understand; to undiscovered lands and new worlds.\"*\n\nA station hangs above a small moon, a human drifting alone among the tumbling rocks of an asteroid ring, a small tram traveling slowly down the shaft of a space elevator, carrying cargo to a small settlement on a red planet. Upon that planet, airships fly slowly over the barren landscape ferrying people and supplies.\n\n*\"Herman Melville, in* Moby Dick *,spoke for wanderers in all epochs and meridians. He said: 'I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas...'\"*\n\nA few humans pause to admire the sunset from the surface of another planet. Fragile structures and habitats cling to asteroids and ships line up waiting to dock. Green-covered land, water, and clouds cling to the inside of a cylindrical worldship. Tiny figures trek across the icy surface on the dark side of a moon, dwarfed and lit by the swirling, stormy bands of atmosphere of a gas titan. Humans with wings strapped to their arms swoop and soar in dense atmosphere on a low-gravity planet. A group of suited figures take turns leaping off of a dizzyingly high cliff, drifting slowly downwards on a ultra-low gravity moon.\n\nAll of it spoke of a people determined to explore every inch of their home system, exulting in the liberating freedom to do so. \n\n-\n\n*\"Maybe it's a little early.\"*\n\nIn the distance, an airship slowly makes its way across a tumultuous sea of towering cloud formations.\n\n*\"Maybe the time is not* quite *yet.\"*\n\nDominating the sky behind it are the sunlit rings of a gas giant.\n\n*\"But those other worlds -promising untold opportunities- beckon.\"*\n\nAs the camera pulls back, a human wearing cold weather gear and a breathing mask is revealed standing on the deck of another airship, admiring the view.\n\n*\"Silently, they orbit the sun.\"*\n\nUnder the faceplate reflecting the rings and above the respirator mask, her eyes crinkle with a smile.\n\n*\"Waiting.\"*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe screen disappeared and, suddenly, our own very similar view took on a new light. \n\nAbove a new colony, I stood on a ship just like that last human. I smiled as her wonder and joy bloomed in my own heart. New worlds yet to be found, new beautiful vistas to appreciate- I *felt* it. I felt pull of the 'final frontier' inside me. The determination to never leave home again was a forgotten memory. I could see it in the faces of my fellow students, too. It felt like we were all on a journey together, exploring the unknown wilds of space. \n\n\"Can anyone tell me when the Federation's cartographers filled in the last empty space of the galactic map?\" Mr. Crank asked the group.\n\nThe euphoric feeling was banished by the sickening reality. \n\n\"Almost 17,000 years ago...\" I said numbly, answering by rote.\n\n\"That's right,\" Mr crank said softly. \"That's how long ago the last explorers lived. Maybe now you can imagine the tremendous, heartbreaking disappointment we felt when we found no stone left unturned. \n\n\"Humans are natural explorers. Our curiosity drives us to go to strange places and try new things that no one ever thought possible. The thing we had dreamed of for so long, the majesty and mystery- all of it had been rendered mundane. You're so used to space travel that it has become old hat. You don't even think about how amazing it is to travel faster than the speed of light. I bet you don't even look out the window if you're in FTL.\"\n\nThe magnitude of what we took for granted was a grievous insult to our ancestors. They had fought and risked and traveled so hard and so much and so far to get us here. And how did we reward this? We forgot them. Those brave, intrepid souls and their grand epics were so much dust in old history books. How would they feel to see their accomplishments treated with such indifference?\n\nIn their day, they would have been the most famous people alive. Everyone would have known their name. They would be admired as idols and hailed as heroes by all. It would have destroyed them to learn what we have become. \n\nHow quickly had the novelty of charting the last bit of unknown space worn off? How long did it take for us to forget those noble explorers? How could we consider ourselves worthy of being their descendants if we couldn't even *remember* them?\n\nAs if he was listening to my thoughts, Mr. Crank coldly asked us the most shameful question of all.\n\n-\n\n\"**Why have you stopped?**\"\n\n-\n\nThat was not an easy question to answer; none of us had ever considered it until now.\n\n\"Because there's nothing left to explore?\" a tentative voice called out.\n\nMr. Crank turned sharply to stare at the speaker, caught off guard by the answer. \"Are you- Are you serious?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" the uncertain reply came.\n\n\"Are you telling me all those other galaxies out there are just pretty lights? You've had **17,000 years** to go to the next one,\" he said angrily, \"What the ***HELL*** makes you think there isn't anything new to see?!\"\n\nIt was a slap to the face. No one had thought of that; we just lived our lives where we were. Life was comfortable and almost never stressful, why make it harder? Everyone in this class was only taking it because they wanted to be FTL qualified mechanical engineers. We hadn't ever considered anything beyond what we were taught.\n\nMr. Crank surveyed our stricken faces for a little while. What he saw hardened his resolve.\n\n\"**That** is why I am here,\" he said, stabbing a finger at the ship, \"I'm the man who wants to help you recapture that sense of adventure your ancient ancestors had. The universe is an unimaginably huge place and you've forgotten that.\n\n\"When we saw that 'pale blue dot'\", he said, turning away, \"we thought, 'Wow, the solar system is a huge place!\" He mimed exaggerated surprise at the view.\n\n\"Then, '**Woah!** There's billions of other star systems in the galaxy? And there are *TRILLIONS* of other galaxies?!'\" He took a sudden step back from the enormity of the idea.\n\n\"That blew our freaking minds,\" he said, turning back to us. \"An incomprehensibly vast unknown, full of amazing things just waiting to be discovered.\"\n\nHe shook his head sadly. \"Carl Sagan and your ancestors would be just has heartbroken as I was when I saw what you have become. I don't know why you stopped looking outwards, but that needs to change. \"\n\n-\n\nHe was right.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*-Biography excerpt of Thoranus Palun, leader of the first expedition to the Andromeda galaxy.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\nThis is a submission for the Teachers category.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Edit: This post is now archived, so you can't vote or comment here.

Unfortunately, the final draft could not be reviewed in time, so if there are any mistakes they are mine.",

The narrative has been one of 'extreme cost' and 'little return for investment' by people in charge of budgets. We got distracted with problems at home. That's why it's taken the private sector to reignite interest. \n\nInspiration and enthusiasm don't count for much when there's a big bill attached, sadly.

            "text": "Became a Humble Monthly subscriber years ago, got a handful of games I liked so I've never cancelled it. Now I'm stuck with a ton of other games I didn't want to play, already had cause of them Steam sales, or just won't ever have the time for.\n\nSo I'm giving away all of the (Steam) keys for the games listed below. Just comment which game you'd like and why. I'll randomly select at the end, unless your reason 1. makes me blow air through my nose harder than I thought possible or 2. moves my cold, dark heart.\n\nCloses on October, 19th 2 PM Hawaii time! Cause I'm 10 hours behind UTC and I have to work. Also formatting might be messed up cause I cut/paste from Google Sheets so excuse any accidentally combined titles and let me know.\n\n\\*edit: fixed a few titles. Specially the entry for a Elite Sniper, it’s V2 not 5. The 2 got stuck to SOMA. And yes you can enter for multiple, entries are considered on a per game basis!\n\n\\*edit 2: Woke up thinking I could reply back to everyone entering, but that’s a lot! Good luck to all, this will be open for 8 more hours as it’s 6:00 AM. And if anyone decided to be that person and enter for all 300+ games, you’ll get 10 random games cause I’m a giveaway noob who didn’t consider that.\n\n\\*edit 3: Giveaway is closed! Thanks for all the participation even though I grossly underestimated how much that would be.  Just waiting on the mods to flair it appropriately. DoctorJunglist is the final entry I’ll accept due to the slight delay as I finished work. I’ll start going through all the entries as soon as I get to my PC. Hope I can have everyone’s patience as I do so and work on sending out prizes.\n\n\\*edit 4: Mods were able to flair it as expired so it’s official. Worked on sorting entries for a few hours today and I’ll probably start sending out codes for the smaller titles tomorrow, once again after work.\n\n\\*edit 5: For anyone still checking on updates!! I decided “edit 4” above was too preemptive. Went through more entries today and it’s unpredictable what games won’t be requested. I’m down to the last maybe 100-300 entries so rewards will be out soon. Let’s see how many more people want to be hurt so good by DS.\n\n\\*edit 6: Well that sure took a long time. I've finally finished sorting through all the valid entries and have begun sending out prizes. They're being sent out in private messages as Humble gift links and I'll be updating the list as I go along with who's won. All prizes should be awarded by tomorrow evening at the current rate I'm going at.\n\n\\*edit 7: I did not know editing a post removes it from the subreddit listing. Yes I am a Reddit noob. I'll add all the winner once they've all been selected then. Thanks to u/Neryuslu for the heads up.\n\n\\*edit 8: Got caught up playing Outer Worlds and Yakuza. Enjoying both a ton, so much so that I forgot to update this. Giveaway is basically over, all games that were entered for have been awarded! Will update this list with winners soon. All remaining games will either be awarded to the random few who said they’ll take any game, put into another giveaway with a longer entry period, or key dumped into another post. Thanks for everyone’s participation and kind words, I definitely won’t ever be doing this again! At least not at this scale, so look forward to monthly giveaways instead as I do one for every Humble Monthly I get.\n\n\\*edit 9: IT'S DONE. All games entered for awarded and winners listed next to them. To explain how I picked out winners, first off I almost always disqualified entries that didn't follow my one rule, pick a game **AND give me a reason why you want it.** I read every single comment here to see who followed that and put them down on a list for each game. The only exceptions were games that had zero entrants following that rule. Then it went to two chances, either I was moved by your comment in some way or you were picked through a random name picker. Congrats to all those who won and better luck next time for those who didn't. Happy gaming to all regardless, now let me get back to mine.\n\n~~>observer\\_~~  **Hevinalle**\n\n~~1993 Space Machine~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~60 Parsecs!~~ **Zombfeud**\n\n~~7 Days to Die~~ **P4NZ3R-IV**\n\n~~911 Operator+DLC~~ **Thorman12345**\n\n~~A Short Hike~~ **MarbleAstronaut**\n\n~~Aaero~~ **FuhrerVonZephyr**\n\n~~Absolver~~  **Etisi**\n\n~~Acceleration of SUGURI 2~~  **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Action Henk~~  **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~AER Memories of Old~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Almost There: The Platformer~~  **Digitaldude555**\n\nAme no Marginal -Rain Marginal-\n\n~~American Truck Simulator~~ **numberphor**\n\n~~Armello~~ **davidpatonred**\n\n~~Ashes of Singularity: Escalation~~ **n0f00d**\n\n~~Avalanche 2: Super Avalanche~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Avernum 2: Crystal Souls~~ **turnipofficer**\n\n~~Avernum 3: Runied World~~ **nerd3awyes**\n\n~~Aviary Attorney~~ **LuckyShot1**\n\n~~Bear With Me - Collector's Edition~~ **CosmeF**\n\n~~Beyond Eyes~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Black Mesa~~ **Asaroth**\n\n~~Black the Fall~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Blackwake~~ **DWhitSlaya**\n\n~~BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend~~ **ScienceRat**\n\n~~Bleed 2~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Brigador: Up-Armored Edition~~ **Barecgesh**\n\n~~BROFORCE~~ **Ballistica**\n\n~~Call of Duty: Black Ops III MP Pack~~ **StrawBerryCrunch**\n\n~~Conan Exiles~~  **turbana**\n\n~~Copoka~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Crawl~~ **FuhrerVonZephyr**\n\n~~Crazy Machines 3~~ **Vorador83**\n\nCthulu **Realms**\n\n~~Cursed Castilla (Maldita Castilla EX)~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Dandara~~ **rubyleehs**\n\n~~Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin~~ **Robstersgaming**\n\n~~DARK SOULS III+Ashes of Ariandel~~ **TheRealKingCole**\n\n~~Darkside Detective~~ **TieIar**\n\n~~Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition~~ **yevva**\n\n~~Dead Island Definitive Edition~~ **TeNppa**\n\n~~Dead Rising 2~~ **MechZombie**\n\n~~Dead Rising 4~~ **bigdaddyguap**\n\n~~Deponia Doomsday~~ **157RiversideAvenue**\n\n~~Deus Ex: Mandkind Divided~~ **particularpixels**\n\n~~DiRT Rally~~ **Exvery**\n\n~~Distance~~ **PuffShay**\n\n~~Do Not Feed the Monkeys~~ **totenial\\_trigger**\n\n~~Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen~~ **rizuxizu**\n\nDungeon of the Endless - Crystal Pack\n\nDungeons 3Duskers\n\n~~Earth Defence Force 4.1+DLC~~ **Drodriguez164**\n\n~~Emily is Away Too~~ **Arkaduisz**\n\n~~Epistory - Typing Chronicles~~ **rickrossticle1213**\n\n~~Eterium~~ **FuhrerVonZephyr**\n\nETHEREAL\n\n~~Event\\[0\\]~~ **HadesDeadlyTom**\n\n~~fault - milestone two side:above~~ **AmadeusOkarin**\n\n~~fault milestone one~~ **Kaedweni**\n\nFidel - Dungeon Rescue\n\n~~Figment~~ **Sairini**\n\n~~Finding Paradise~~ **yevva**\n\nFlat Heroes\n\nForged Battalion\n\n~~Forts~~ **Coconecoli**\n\nFortune-499\n\n~~Fran Bown~~ **Coconecoli**\n\nFull Metal Furies\n\n~~Galactic Civilizations III~~ **Captain\\_Bastable**\n\n~~Galak-Z~~  **filmskoolfulci**\n\nGemini: Heroes Reborn\n\n~~Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy~~ **SwiftTime00**\n\n~~God's Trigger~~ **Err0r2**\n\nGoNNER - Press Jump to Die Edition\n\nGRAV\n\n~~Gremlins, Inc.~~ **Spyguy001**\n\n~~Grey Goo Definitive Edition~~ **Pyramordial**\n\n~~Grim Dawn~~ **drozzi007**\n\n~~Guacamelee! 2~~ **StorySham**\n\nGunmetal Arcadio Zero\n\n~~H1Z1~~ **RhinoInAHat**\n\n~~HackyZack~~ **Digitaldude555**\n\n~~Hard Reset Redux~~ **MoistCloister**\n\n~~Hearts of Iron IV~~ **Arctic\\_Funky**\n\n~~Hidden Folks~~ **LittleRedQuinn**\n\nHighway Blossoms\n\nHIVESWAP: Act 1\n\n~~Hollow Knight~~ **General\\_Pretzel**\n\n~~Holy Potatoes!

However due to unknowingly using clay that was infused with human ashes from the camp's furnace, the negative emotions corrupted the rituals and created a [corpse gatherer](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130828141829/etheria/images/f/f4/Corpse_Gatherer.jpg) instead.  \n  \n2) A batch of dragon eggs is found in Wales.  The British military already has plans on using the dragons as weapons against the Axis forces.  Potential plot twist is the a Nazi spy has infiltrated the military and is planning on stealing the eggs.  \n  \n3) The detonation of Trinity results in opening up a portal to another world (Biblical Hell, The Far Realms, or even the Forgotten Realms are all good choices).  \n  \n4) The US military start fielding weapons that were reversed engineered from wreckage from a UFO crash in Roswell (I know the crash happened two years after the war ended, but work with me here.)  \n  \n5) Nazi zombies... 'nuff said.  \n  \n6) A allied soldier is struck by a bullet that lodges in his body. Shortly afterwords he begins hearing a voice in his head. The voice claims to be the bullet and it seems to know things that the soldier cannot of possibly known himself. u/PureLoop  \n  \n7) A World War I battle is replayed by the ghosts of the dead that participated it, in the middle of a World War II battlefield, causing chaos and confusion among the living. u/PureLoop  \n  \n8) A single time traveling soldier from after the war returns to prevent the loss of the Allied nations by assassinating Allied leaders. u/PureLoop  \n  \n9) A poltergeist of unknown origins causes the deliberate misfiring of guns within the confines of rubble that used to be their school. u/PureLoop  \n  \n10) In order to combat the recently developed biological weapon that is Nazi Zombies, American soldiers become unwitting test subjects of Lycanthropy. u/PureLoop  \n  \n11) A meteor strikes the heart of a battlefield, causing an enormous explosion. From the crater countless bug like creatures swarm out and attack all living beings near by. Allied and Axis soldiers are forced into a cease fire to defeat the alien foe. u/PureLoop  \n  \n12) A batch of bad rations cause nightmarish hallucinations for those that ate it. It soon becomes clear the that hallucinations were actually warped premonitions of the eaters fate in the war. u/PureLoop  \n  \n13) Nazi scientist develop a cannon that ruptures the bonds that hold a soul in place. Unleashing it in battle they destroy an entire allied platoon in one shot, only to be violently torn apart by the vengeful souls. u/PureLoop  \n  \n14) A decapitated head that appears to be still talking is found in the battlefield. When wind is passed over it's vocal cords it shouts a string of obscenities about Nazi scum and that it will take more than a tank to stop him. Unless the head is destroyed, the soldier remains alive. u/PureLoop  \n  \n15) Death being overburdened by the war recruits a recently deceased soldier to act as his aid and help him gather the souls from the bodies. The soldier learns that if he does not lift the soul from the body of the mortally injured, they remain alive and in terrible suffering, and thus must choose who among his battalion he has to kill out of mercy. u/PureLoop  \n  \n16) A Chaplin is the soul survivor of a battle between forces in a small french village. He speaks of a rapture by God who came down and smote all who participated in the heinous war. It comes to light that several of the dead at the battlefield were struck with tremendous force, and have bite marks on their bodies. Eventually it's discovered that the Chaplin was a vampire, though were he is now, no one knows. u/PureLoop  \n  \n17) Nazi aquatic tanks and APV's suddenly appear on the beaches of Delaware, ushering and new front on the American coast. u/PureLoop  \n  \n18) Two islands with separate operations occurring on them in the Pacific front begin moving towards one another before colliding. Both islands turn out to be massive sea creatures that then attack one another, utter destroying the armies above them. u/PureLoop  \n  \n19) In Paris, several off-duty Nazi officers, drunk off of cheap wine, end up getting lost in the catacombs.  They inadvertently destroy a shrine or glyphs, resulting in releasing several hundred angry spirits.  \n  \n20) During the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, several American GIs and German stormtroopers end up becoming the target of a Wild Hunt.  \n  \n21) A time-traveler, attempting to assassinate Hitler, is captured, and his technology is reverse-engineered to aid the German war effort.  \n  \n22) The golem of Prague, left dormant until it was needed, is reawakened. u/I_walked_east  \n  \n23) The head of Bran is buried under the Tower of London and protects England from invasion. The power of the head scuttled the Spanish Armada. Now Nazis plan to steal it in preparation for their invasion. u/I_walked_east  \n  \n24) The ghosts of victims of Unit 731 are hunted by a sadistic band of exorcists. u/I_walked_east  \n  \n25) The Spanish fascists find Durandal, the sword of Roland, that has the power to cut mountains. u/I_walked_east  \n  \n26) The Nazis have captured Baba Yaga, who has been helping the Russian all woman 588th night bombers (aka The Night Witches) repel the German Invasion. u/I_walked_east  \n  \n27) In the woods surrounding Los Angeles Nazi sympathizers know as the Grey Shirts perform dark rituals at a secret compound. u/I_walked_east  \n  \n28) At the American naval base on Midway, Private Second Class Leeroy Beck’s last sight as he bleeds out through his slit throat is a Japanese soldier morphing into an exact copy of him, trying to hide a large fox tail within a duffel bag. u/Pretzelbomber  \n  \n29) Charles de Gaulle was actually a necromancer the entire time, and manages to stall the Germans using the wandering souls of the catacombs. u/OctoyeetTraveler  \n  \n30) In the face of invasion, occupation, and possible annihilation at the hands of the invading German forces, the elders of a Russian village send their bravest into the forest to meet with the fae folk to make a deal.  Will the village be willing or able to pay the price for protection against the Nazis?  \n  \n31) A Soviet submarine accidentally opens an underwater portal to the Elemental Plane of Water during a nuclear test. The crew must find a way to seal the portal and deal with the creatures that initially made it through. u/JollyGreenStone  \n  \n32) Elves are found in the Black Forest. The Nazis conspire with the Elves: if the Elves can push back the Russians on the Eastern Front, they'll receive Ukraine and Belarus as a new sanctuary. The Elves agree because they see all humans as inferior and they believe after defeating Stalin they can defeat Hitler. u/JollyGreenStone  \n  \n33) A mad Nazi doctor in a concentration camp creates lycanthrope soldiers who transform, kill the staff, and take over the village. Invading Allied forces have to save the camp's prisoners from the feral lycanthropes. u/JollyGreenStone  \n  \n34) On both the Allied and Axis sides, soldiers find themselves unable to die. Made immortal by some strange force which causes them to cling onto death (despite suffering grievous injuries which refuse to heal) all they can do is keep on fighting.  Both sides must investigate the cause behind this lest the war never end and devolve into pure, mindless slaughter. u/Sobek6  \n  \n35) Midway through the war and despite previous reports, the German forces have suddenly gained an advantage. Using new weaponry and possessing new successful approaches to warfare they look set to be unbeatable.  It turns out that Germany has finally cracked communications across dimensions and Hitler is receiving advice from alternate versions of himself.  (Perhaps there’s room for a version of Hitler that never became the monster history remembers him as to become a potential ally?) u/Sobek6  \n  \n36) In the Pacific Theater, planes on both sides have been suffering malfunctions on a near regular basis, with both sides accusing each other of sabotage.  The malfunctions began after a battle on an unnamed island which ended up destroying a small shrine.  Are the malfunctions truly the work of sabotage?  Is it gremlins doing what gremlins do best?  Or have the island spirits been angered by the desecration of the shrine?  \n  \n37) The Nazis' occult sciences division have been designing an engine that can run off the souls of the deceased.  An Allied spy has been attempting to stall development, but has been reporting that the soul engine is almost ready for deployment in the Russian front.  A team must be sent in to extract the spy and either retrieve or destroy the blueprints and the prototype engine. u/Th3R3493r  \n  \n38) In response to the Polish resistance weaponizing golems with help from kabbalists, the Nazis have been attempting to mass-produce their own golems.  So far efforts have been stymied by uncooperative Jewish prisoners, who often sabotage the golems by either making them fragile or programming them to attack their masters whenever they hear German, and the Third Reich's distrusts of \"Juden Witchcraft\". u/Th3R3493r  \n  \n39) Due the Japanese's ill-treatment of the Chinese dead in Manchuria, Qui Shen (Chinese wraiths) have been rising in droves and attacking the invading Japanese soldiers.  The attacks were originally random, lately they seem to be directed in such a way to be as damaging as possible.  Either an exceptionally powerful Qui Shen is leading the attacks, or a powerful fangshi (type of Chinese wizard) has gain control of the undead. u/Th3R3493r  \n  \n40) Oni are operating as mercenaries in the Pacific theater, selling their services to the highest bidder (typically whoever can offer the best alcohol and the prettiest girls). u/Th3R3493r  \n  \n41) Having perfected a powerful and easily portable shielding spell, Axis paratroopers are now dropped without parachutes. r/Holy_Hand_Grenadier  \n  \n42) Hitler's invasion of England is under way, and the Royal Family has been captured or assassinated. In the country's darkest hour, King Arthur returns, wielding Excalibur. r/Holy_Hand_Grenadier    \n  \n43) The UK discovers that the Loch Ness monster is really a plesiosaur and that the bottom of the Loch contains a portal to an alternate Earth ... where dinosaurs still roam. Can the British expedition recover enough resources from this resource rich world to aid the war effort? r/PutridMeatPuppet  \n  \n44) The nazi's have perfected an Aryan ritual, thinking it will allow them control over destiny. It instead unleashes an avatar of the demiurge who is rampaging across both frontlines. r/stamau123  \n  \n45) Almost an entire batallion of captured Enemy Prisoners of War all spontaneously go catatonic, and then collectively, robotically, begin reciting biblical passages in Olmec, backwards for 3 hours, and 3 minutes every 27 hours and 27 minutes. Every prisoner repeats a different selection of passages and refuses to eat or drink, returning to a catatonic state between cycles. When sedated, additional prisoners fall catatonic and begin chanting where the others left off... those that die continue to move, unless cremated, at which point a new prisoner joins the chorus. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n46) The metal inside every shell, shell casing, and bullet in Easy Company's ammunition train spontaneously liquified, pooling at the bottom of the containers. The explosives inside were undisturbed. The logistics crew tasked with guarding the train were all struck with dissociative hysterical blindness. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n47) The local sex workers in the villages nearest the front speak of \"La Dame sans merci\" wearing a shimmering gown of purest black silk and with a touch capable of freezing a man to death instantly. There have been nine corpsman found dead from an unknown cause within the last 27 days, locally. The sex workers claim it to be her work. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n48) Our soldiers report sightings of spectral cavalry riding ghost horses during the last battle. The knights wore feathered wings upon thier back. They wiped out all but one member of three platoons, who report as witness. The witness beleives the men were all slashed to death with swords and spears. Autopsy supports this statement. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n49) An Allied Radio Operator for the 589th Field Artillery Battallion reports receiving requests for artillery strikes calling for a fire mission directly on the calling unit's position a full 24 hours before said unit had actually arrived in the combat zone. The radio-man and a second operator on duty reported details of the battle they heard accurately, before the events actually occured. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n50) Bomber crews report sightings of unlit and unflagged \"Black Bombers\" joining thier formation shortly before bombs are dropped, sometimes doubling thier numbers in formation. Missions where such sightings have occured have a 56% higher loss rate than those without these sightings. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n51) After several hours of listening for enemy radio activity during bouts of heightened ionospheric activty, a handful of Radio Operators develop obsessive compulsions to scrawl out the strangely shaped Hexagramatic runes contained within several Elder Signs. The operators continue to repeat the glyphs until thier fingertips wear off to bloody stumps. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n52) Eighteen enemy soldiers fall ill and die after desecrating a shrine to an obscure saint in a tiny church a few miles behind the front-lines. A special forces unit of crack troops crossed the lines to help meet and retrieve what they found, only to report the incident. Three of those soldiers found dead were our boys under-cover or were double agents. Just what did they uncover? r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n53) The boffins coming out of SRI in Menlo Park (known in certain circles for powerful 'psychotronic research') have requested OSS (the precursor to the CIA) support for something they're calling Operation MOON WICKET. OSS explains, they need a platoon of soldiers near the front-lines to sit inside a dark water tank for days on end under specific conditions outlined in the mission parameters and to be strictly adhered to! (The common soldiers are to report on thier psychic experiences, despite up until now, never having heard the words: 'psychotronic research') It is critical that the unit's position not be discovered until after the operation has been completed, after which an elaborate counter-intelligence ruse will be perpetrated to obscure any hint of the research-site. The soldiers are told that this is to be their R&R, but the rules are stricter than normal, and punishments for breaking these rules are severe. (Not much of a R&R, if you ask the soldiers, and as the enemy draws closer, internal tension are high.) The OSS spooks, on the other hand, have been told that should the research not be completed before the enemy locates and overruns the village, that the enemy must not be allowed to take any prisoners, alive or dead; whatever the \"or dead\" part means, the spooks aren't sure. (The pressure is getting to them, which one will crack first?) r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n54) Under orders from the OSS Black branch, upon retaking of the city by US 5th Army Infantry forces, available units must clear out Nazi holdouts in the sewers beneath the Temple of the Magna Mater in Rome, and secure the contents of the temple at all costs; but instead find an infestation of Ghouls, some in SS uniform and armed with automatic weaponry, and seem to be able to dissapear in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately the temple was already looted by the Nazi Karotechia. The contents of the temple could no doubt give the Nazis tools to turn the tide, (should thier occult research be as advanced as the Allies) and possibly allow them to retake much of the ground lost since D-Day. It is imperative that the contents of the temple prior to the Nazi looting be verified in order to gain an understanding of Nazi capabilities. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n55) According to your most recent orders, Allied Army Airforce planes carrying vital one of a kind equipment, and research personell to support General Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese Theater's War Effort, crashed somewhere over \"The Hump\" (The Eastern Himilayas) due to enemy air patrols that shouldn't have been there, according to intellegence. A brief radio message has gotten through, confirming the safety of the pilots; you have been tasked with establishing a hasty expedition to retrieve them and the \"package\". It is the depths of winter, prey that you and your men do not encounter the dreaded Yeti, or the armed occult forces protecting the secrets of Hidden Shangrala and Kublai Kahn's Pleasure Domes from outsiders; both secret and unknowable threats to a Westerner. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n56) Dr Moreau's research has been wholeheartedly adopted by the Soviets, creating an entire Regiment of Hybrid Ape-men shock-troops, with Never-Before-Seen Heavy Mechanized-Infantry Weapon systems of a design more advanced than even Axis or Allied Scientists could devise. The truth is, these forces arrived from an alternate future; stop the inciting event from forming a closed-timeloop, and the never-ending fountain of Ape-troops and Super-Science Materiel might stop, and prevent a Future Soviet Union from winning the Cold War (even now a Distant Nightmare Vision in the minds of Allied Oneiromancers; worse even than an Axis victory!) r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n57) Something is destroying Japanese submarines in the pacific at a frightening pace. American warships, equipped with a new sonar technology, have detected an enormous signal that appears to be biological in nature. The size and speed have caused the scientists to speculate about the old stories of giant squids or kraken. r/PutridMeatPuppet  \n  \n58) In 1930, Albert Einstein discovers that he is the second reincarnation of Isaac Newton, after a chance encounter with a Romani spiritualist and in the process discovered that Gauss was the first. Guided by his former life's work with Alchemy, he develops the theory on the General Equivalence of Energy Exchange and Matter Creation and launched the search for a rigorous understandings of the underpinnings of High Energy Magicks. In his research, in 1933 Weimar Germany, he is contacted by a war-weary version of his future self, who convinces him he must defect to the United States to avoid a horrific fate. The OSS Black Branch has tasked you, a local operative undercover in Europe to extract Einstein and see him safely to the States; except the current year is 1945; The Black Branch has cryptically warned you that Einstein has been killed sixteen times over numerous timelines, and that it is imperative that he remain unharmed in this one... will the reality of the multiverse tear your sanity apart? r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n59) At sundown on the autumn equinox, 1940; a plucky 20-something female Home Guard volunteer, who up-until-now had not revealed that she was a Witch, managed to hold off a scouting party of at least one Company of German forces in the early days of Unternehmen Seelöwe (Operation Sea Lion), outside the small coastal village of Pepperinge-Eye near Dorsetshire. Her defense bought the small village time to evacuate, (unsupported due to a massive, coordinated assault across the Southern Coast of England by the invading Germans, leading to a general evacuation known as Operation Dynamo II) and for three days and nights engaged the enemy long enough for scattered elements of VII Corps and the 70th Independent Infantry Brigade to arrive. Should the undermanned, undertrained, and under supported Guerilla forces of VII Corps, fail in their defense of the fighting retreat London could have been lost during the Siege. Instead, she (and as it later turned out, other members of the New Forest Coven) helped to bog down the Nazi advance all along their advancing front. Marylinn Myrddin Eglantine-Price was awarded Conspicuous Gallantry Medal for her actions in the battle called \"Bedknob Hill\". Witnesses report extensive wreckage consisting of household and kitchen items said to be \"floating in the air on their own and holding Jerries prisoner, afraid for their lives\", as well as dozens of flags and even one bullet-riddled suit of plate-armor! r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n60) An Australian Division has been capturing and training bunyips and releasing them in Asian Jungles for use against the Japanese. Allied forces are instructed to say 'lollipop lick liquor lover like Lillihammer' or anything with a lot of 'L's in it if you hear a bark that sounds like a dog mixed with a walrus as the Japanese forces who do not practice usually do not say 'L's correctly. They are stealthy as the grave and have been seen killing crocodiles with ease. r/Th3R3493r  \n  \n61) The Nazi SS Occult research and development have made a \"perfect\" machine gunner. It is an abomination made of sewn flesh that can hold two hundred kilograms of bullets, two modified MG-42s, is armored to take a large quantity of small arms fire without losing momentum. It lacks a head but has three eyes in their aiming upper arms to aim each gun independently and two sets of arms to reload and fix the machine guns. Where they are getting the bodies are theorized to be one willing living subject and at least 3 undamaged dead bodies. They are questionable loyal to the units and are known to kill friend and foe alike who crosses their lines of fire. r/Th3R3493r  \n  \n62) In the early days of the war, both the Germans and Allies made extreme advancements in Optics, driven perhaps by research into early radar prototypes. Progress was also fueled by the need to predict airstrikes before they occur, and the promises of early stage resarch into Applied Occult Prognostication, for both sides. By 1941, two independent programs, codenamed MÍMISBRUNNR and BARONSATURDAY, by the Germans and Allies respectively, were of sufficiently advanced stages as to be applied to the war effort directly. Independently, both sides had realized the importance of extensive pharmaceutical and surgical modification. Should the subject survive the chemical treatments, and surgery, of which denucleation was one important step, the resulting high rates of insanity and chemical dependency eventually led to a curtailment and confinement to asylum of members of both programs before the end of the war. A friend of yours has undergone this procedure, has foreseen the results, and begs you to help them escape their fate. r/MaxSizeIs  \n  \n63) War is at a stalemate, both sides are looking for a way to open up new a new front. This brings them to the under dark where both sides try to sway the drow empress to join them. As the drow contemplate wheter to join one side or the other both british and german covert agents wage a shadow war even the drow can't see. r/AllSeeingCCTV  \n  \n64) Early on in the war, Himmler and the Thule Society accidentally stumbled across a ritual which allowed them to open portals to other universes. Now the Nazis find their forces bolstered by fascist doppelgangers and malevolent/sympathetic alternative versions of members of the Allied Forces. Rumour has it Hitler himself often seeks audience with a council of versions of himself. r/Sobek6  \n  \n65) The Allies begin formalization of a Magician Corps, from priests and rabbis who demonstrably and reliably performed miracles, to so-called \"witch doctors\", women accused of witchcraft, and American natives rumored to wield their own magic. Some of them don't really have anything truly mystical, while others find that their miracles and magics work so fundamentally different as to interfere with each others' workings. Meanwhile, the Thule Society under Nazi Germany has been regularly unearthing artifacts, which the leadership orders utilized in the war effort without attempting to properly understand each one, leading to mixed and unpredictable results. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n66) A detachment of advanced Nazi submarines begins raiding the American coast, beaching under the surf and releasing nixes trained as amphibious soldiery. America has its own amphibious horrors as well, though- the Deep Ones, finding their hidden holdings threatened by this new battleground, begin their own off-the-books contributions to the war. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n67) A shadowy wraith levitates the Shah of Iran and severs his head from his body in broad daylight, days before what would have been the invasion of Iran by Soviet and Allied forces. It is recognized as a kind of specter typically employed by British magicians, and so the full, if still outdated, military might of Iran mobilizes as quickly as it can. It is still crushed, but the Shah's supporters manage to lionize his legacy in the national eye as someone who would have created a more independent Iran up until his death at foreign hands. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n68) Stregherian witches in both New England and Old Italy call upon their deities to nourish and poison, to send storms and fair weather, and to bring luck and fair fortune to the boys they send to the front lines. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n69) In the chaos of battle, rifts in time release warriors from centuries past and future. In the Vienna Offensive, Mongols spill out onto the streets and further compound civilian casualties in the confusion. A lone jet fighter from the Pan-Pacific Union spontaneously appears over Japan with weapons white-hot, accidentally taking out two bombers from the Doolittle Raid with charged-particle weaponry before fatally crashing into a third, causing America to mistakenly believe Japan's air superiority and readiness even more powerful than they thought. Small numbers of Ottoman Janissaries are inexplicably found in Greecian cities, helping resist the Italian invasion and later dying to a man in Nazi occupation. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n70) With British psi intelligence offices having cracked the Enigma code, Alan Turing is brought onto a long-term project few minds have the aptitude for- the development of automated soldiers that could end not only this war, but any war Britain would have to prosecute after. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n71) Two black American infantry battalions are subjected to vampirism and lycanthropy, respectively, as an initial assessment of the effectiveness of each on logistical, tactical, and strategic levels. There's no way even a word of this can be leaked to anyone back home, though, so they're sent on only the most dangerous, far-reaching covert missions, becoming the bogeymen that every Axis soldier fears. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n72) The dying Great Clans of Mars can wait no longer, and regrettably must colonize the Earth before the global life support railwork collapses and kills every last Martian. Long-distance radio signals are picked up from Mars, indicating in over thirty Earthling languages that the Martians will offer full military support to whichever faction of primitives can guarantee the most land to the Great Clans. r/archDeaconstructor  \n  \n73) Rumor starts spreading about the \"seven for one deal\"; if you find a pistol magazine with bizarre symbols and untranslatable words on it, load seven rounds, and insert it in your pistol, each of those seven rounds will strike true if it is any way physically possible for them to do so. But after the 7th round is fired, fatal calamity instantly befalls the shooter. r/Vote_for_Knife_Party  \n  \n74) Good news: the Army isn't putting saltpeter in the rations to dull your libido. Bad news: they're putting experimental mood adjusters in the rations to get you to associate violence with pleasure, and the squad machine gunner keeps giving you this look while he cleans his weapon... r/Vote_for_Knife_Party  \n  \n75) There are no atheists in foxholes, but there sure are a lot of accidental devil worshippers. Demons are having a field day going from fighting hole to fighting hole, ready to cut a deal for survival. Sure, you'll survive the battle, but in the heat of the moment did you think to specify how long? r/Vote_for_Knife_Party  \n  \n76) In the highlands of SE Asia, Japanese troops have forced Chinese and British troops to fall back. But something that lives in those mountain passes of the SE Himalayas is mauling the Japanese soldiers at night ... and locals are mentioning the term “Yeti”. r/PutridMeatPuppet  \n  \n77) Theories of a Hollow Earth are partially true. Although the Earth is not truly hollow, its more like Swiss cheese with tunnels traveling deep underground and undersea ... and it opens up a new front in the war as both sides scramble to explore these tunnels and move troops thru the core of the Earth to strike at their enemies on the surface. Things take a turn for the weird when both sides encounter species native to these underground travel routes... r/PutridMeatPuppet  \n  \n78) An increasingly paranoid Joseph Stalin seeks to recreate the rituals of Koschei the Deathless and become immortal. He has begun to harrase the tribal peoples of Siberea in an attempt to force the secret from them. r/Patchwork18  \n  \n79) First contact has been made, and the aliens want... Entertainment? Turns out that they view war as a spectator sport, and start giving out advanced technology to the armies that amuse them the most. Do you try and win their favour? Or perhaps someone should stop them before the war becomes the apocalypse! r/deadgaiko  \n  \n80) One day, without warning, every projectile weapon on the planet ceases to function. Guns jam, bombs explode before deployment, even bow strings instantly snap! Chaos ensues as battlefield tactics are forced to adapt. Weeks later, delayed intelligence reaches both sides: The neutral state of Vatican City have discovered a powerful artifact with reality-bending powers... r/deadgaiko  \n  \n81) Fiji mermaids are real. They're a boogeyman while out in the Pacific, feeding off those sleeping. The Axis powers are really interested in capturing one alive: They're venom is known to have strange hallucinogenic properties. r/Thepipe90  \n  \n82) There is rumors of a circus roaming the Europeon countryside; putting on shows for whoever will take them in for the night. Allied brass thinks they are a bunch of spies. The truth is much worse: The circus is made up of damned souls. The firebreather can do more with fire than just breathe it,The strongman can flip a tank like an end table, and the clowns are ACTUALLY fitting into those tiny cars. All that makeup? Not just to make them look cheery and silly.... r/Thepipe90  \n  \n83) The SS’s pagan worship has awakened a lovecraftian eldritch horror r/TheMarvelMan  \n  \n84) It turns out Hitler is an alien with immense mind control powers who has hypnotized the axis into starting the war so the world will descend into chaos so it cannot effectively resist the incoming alien invasion. r/AndreTheSalty  \n  \n85) Allied scientists unlock humanity's psionic potential. Thanks to a injected serum specially chosen and selected members unlock the power to read minds, throw objects with the power of thought, control others like puppets, and cause enemy's heads to explode. This advantage allows the allies to make huge advances however the germans manage to reverse engineer the serum, giving it to their own men. This results in the war becoming even more brutal and bloody as these psi troops are produced in increasing numbers. r/AndreTheSalty  \n  \n86) Rumors of monsters attacking the Japs in a occupied Philippines has reached the ears of the emperor. They kept saying words like 'aswang', 'duwende', 'magkukulang', and 'tikbalang' among other words that seemed to be more stranger than the next. r/CAvenir  \n  \n87) The back of soldiers dog tags suddenly display the name of the person who will kill them. The trouble is, not all of the names belong to enemies. r/HarshMillennium",

The extremely advanced Asgardian hyperdrive, capable of traversing intergalactic distances in the span of a day, is still functional, however. The Mjolnir Class Explorer will have a crew compliment of:\n\n\\-One Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet Thor (not the god, but the little grey Stargate alien of the same name)\n\n\\-The Mjolnir Class Explorer's AI, which will continue to operate the ship autonomously even without a commander\n\n\\-One Replicator specimen held in temporal stasis so that it can't replicate\n\n\\-One Ascended Ancient who was a friend of Thor's in life millions of years ago, and who was watching over him without interfering in any way at the time she was sucked away.\n\nThor's current mission is to study the Replicators to determine a way of destroying them, but his ship is damaged and he needs to repair it, and he was planning to come to Earth in order to seek assistance from his human allies for materials and manpower. Thor's number-one priority is to keep the Replicator specimen contained, but if his ship is destroyed or sufficiently damaged for some reason, the Replicator's containment field will fail and it will start replicating wherever it finds itself. The Ascended Ancient is totally unwilling to interfere in the affairs of mortals, per her code of non-interference, but she will also prevent any other entities she considers to be 'ascended' beings from interfering, like the Ancients did when they prevented the Ori from interacting with the Milky Way Galaxy for millions of years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Marvel X-men character Gladiator (not an X-man himself, but an alien in the X-man stories) as he is traveling through space on a mission to save the Queen of the Shi'ar Space Empire on Earth after she crash-landed there. He can rip planets apart with his bare hands and survive supernovae, as well as attacks from the Phoenix Force, an entity which caused the Big Bang, so, an impressive feat. Just like how the Hulk's powers come from his anger, Gladiator's powers come from his devotion to his cause, so as long as he remains totally devoted and loyal to his Queen, he's basically unstoppable, but if something makes his devotion waiver, he will drop in power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLord Vivec from Morrowind, who, for the sake of this scenario, we will say literally flew up into space after he vanished from the Elder Scrolls setting, and was up among the stars meditating for several hundred years, sitting on a gigantic asteroid similar in size to the one that caused the K-T extinction event, and which had previously been innocently floating in deep space before getting sucked into the Warp. Vivec is fully chimmed out, which means he is aware that he is a fictional character in a dream and can control what happens in the dream in much the same way that a person having a lucid dream can make things happen. He's also \"extremely quirky\" and can re-write history if he likes. He has no goals, and will happily continue floating in space if nothing bothers him, but if he really doesn't like something, it's no problem for him to erase it from time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- - -\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these are entrained in the Warp-wake of the ork space hulk and pulled off course, through the Warp, to be deposited in random stable orbits around Earth Bet from the Worm/Ward universe, prior to the events of Gold Morning, directly following the point in the story where Kevin Norton, the homeless man who 'controls' Zion, gives 'control' of Zion over to Lisette, and before Behemoth was set to attack New Dehli.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe emergence of the space hulk and other objects out of the Warp above Earth Bet constitutes an event that no precog on Earth Bet, not even Fortuna, could foresee, and consequently, the normal course of events in the story of Worm is permanently derailed. Most notably, no matter what else happens, Gold Morning will no longer occur for at least one million years, and may never occur.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe emergence of the space hulk into orbit around Earth Bet will also rip open a permanent Warp rift to the 40k Warp, capable of spitting out somewhere between 6 and 666 daemons of the Warp once per day, who will rain down in an unrelenting stream to Earth Bet's surface. Notably, this Warp rift is open on ALL version of Earth in the Worm/Ward setting, not just Earth Bet, similar to how the Titans in Ward were present in all Earths simultaneously. The rain of daemons, likewise, will be 6-666 daemons per Worm/Ward multiverse Earth, not just on Earth Bet. Traveling into the Warp rift will allow entry into the 40k Warp, and exit from the Warp rift will spit someone back out with a 50% chance that they end up on Earth Bet and a 50% chance that they end up on any other Worm/Ward Earth. Any Worm/Ward characters who enters the Warp will temporarily loose connection to their shards/passengers while in the Warp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Warp rift will also open the eyes of the four gods of Chaos from 40k, Tzeench, Nurgle, Khorne, and Slaanesh, as well as Gork and Mork, and the throne-bound Emperor of Mankind onto all the Worm/Ward Earths, and Zion will simultaneously become aware of these other gods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to this Warp rift, the arrival of the ork space hulk will also trigger a resonance cascade à la Half Life, opening up random portals to the border world Xen all over Earth Bet, as well as all the other Worm/Ward Earths. This will cause the Nihilanth (and the Nihilanth's masters) to begin trying to invade the Worm/Ward worlds, as in Half Life, and if anyone pulls a Gordon Freeman and kills the Nihilanth somehow, that will cause the cloaking afforded by the Nihilanth to drop, and the Combine will start getting involved. We don't know the size of the forces of Xen or the Combine, but the former fought on an even keel with the US military in Half Life, and the Combine ROFLstomped the militaries of the whole world in seven hours in Half Life 2, so that should give you a rough idea of their respective powers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG-Man will become involved somehow, as will his employers, but who knows what he or they want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe presence of Count Dooku and Asajj Ventress, as well as the other midi-chlorian-bearing life forms on the Lucrehulk, will extend the Force into the scenario, and the Force will continue to be present until all Star Wars life forms, including midi-chlorian-bearing microbes carried on the Lucrehulk, are dead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hyperdrive technology of the Star Wars, Star Trek, and Stargate ships will continue to function as normal, but since the Star Wars ships won't have the star charts of the Milky Way galaxy that would be required to safely navigate gravity wells, they'll run a 50% risk of blowing up if they try to travel interstellar distances. However, since Star Trek and Stargate hyperdrives don't have this problem, they will be able to go pretty much wherever they want in the galaxy in a few decades/minutes, respectively. Likewise, Goliath will retain his ability to fly anywhere in the universe within several weeks/months. These FTL abilities will all be intensely interesting to the Simurgh, who, unlike Zion, is still functioning as a failsafe in case the Worm-cycle gets interrupted, and would very much like to use the FTL technology/natural biological abilities of Goliath to re-contact another Worm-entity, possibly the same one that cucked Zion. If she succeeds in this, that Worm-entity will also enter the scenario, arriving at Earth using the FTL commandeered or reverse-engineered by the Simurgh to re-contact it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will say as a precondition that if Zion encounters the Worm-entity that cucked him, he will basically go Gold Morning on him in revenge, and after the two fight, both will be so badly damaged that neither will be able to do anything (similar to what happened to Eden after she cucked Zion by murder-fucking the third Worm-entity), resulting in a scenario similar to what happened after Gold Morning in Ward, except without the global destruction or the big cape fight. If that happens, though, you will get broken triggers and a broken cycle that eventually leads to Titans developing in the next few years/decades. This wouldn't be what the Simurgh wanted, and if it happens, she may try to contact other Worm-entities using hyperdrive travel (though that might be difficult, given their universal distribution), or she might decide to try extending her influence to some of the other planets that the newcomers come from by using the Warp, or she might decide it isn't worth the hassle, up to you, depends on what happens in the scenario and what would make sense for her. Note, it's been speculated by characters in Ward that Worm-based superpowers stop functioning in space, but we've actually seen that both Zion and the Simurgh are still capable of using powers in space, but are they special cases, or were Victoria and Lab Rat just wrong as a matter of fact? Who knows, up to you to decide whether Worm/Ward superpowers can leave Earth in this scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the sake of the scenario, we will state that the various ascended beings involved;\n\n\\-Zion\n\n\\-the Worm-entity that cucked Zion (if it gets involved by the Simurgh or somehow else)\n\n\\-the Force from Star Wars\n\n\\-the Ascended Ancient from Stargate\n\n\\-Vivec\n\n\\-Tzeench\n\n\\-Nurgle\n\n\\-Slaanesh\n\n\\-Khorne\n\n\\-Gork and Mork\n\n\\-the throne-bound Emperor of Mankind\n\n\\-the Nihilanth's masters\n\n\\-the Combine overlords (if the Nihilanth dies somehow and the Combine get involved)\n\n\\-the Vortessence (if the Nihilanth dies somehow and a large number of Vortigaunts survive and end up freed)\n\n\\-G-Man's employers\n\nwill each be able to 'stop' one other ascended being from directly influencing anything in the scenario, at the cost of making it so that they have to spend all their time 'stopping' the ascended being they've chosen to oppose, making it so that they themselves can't directly influence anything in the scenario either. Theoretically, Vivec could be way stronger than all the others (he literally and figuratively fucked a bunch of gods in the Elder Scrolls setting), but we'll just say that they're all roughly equal for this purpose, and any one can stalemate any other. All of these 'ascended' beings are also 'beyond' the precog powers of the Simurgh, Fortuna, Count Dooku, and all other non-ascended precogs in this scenario, and just like how Fortuna couldn't tell what Zion was going to do or use her Path-to-Victory power on him, she can't use her Path-to-Victory power directly against any of the other ascended beings. Also, for the sake of the scenario, let's just say that Fortuna's Path-to-Victory power can't handle honest-to-goodness time travelers like G-Man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen one ascended being 'stops' another, neither of them can influence the scenario, until the one doing the 'stopping' decides to give up. As long as no other ascended beings are 'stopping' other ascended beings, they can influence the scenario as they normally would. Gork and Mork are currently 'stopping' each other, but if they pause their own fight for some reason, they can get involved in stopping two other ascended powers or interfere more directly in events. The Nihilanth's masters will already be 'stopping' the Combine overlords at the beginning of the scenario, and they can't stop for any reason, unless the Nihilanth dies. G-Man's employers will not make themselves known to the other ascended powers if they can help it, and consequently, will not try to 'stop' any other powers directly. Also, the Emperor of Mankind probably won't have any stake in any of this, but he will be aware of it through the Warp, and could intervene somehow if he really wanted to. Could a Living Saint get involved here? Up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf another ascended power stops Zion, it will result in post-Gold-Morning-like conditions where powers are no longer being regulated normally and broken triggers will occur more often, and Zion's avatar won't be able to do anything. If this 'stopping' of Zion continues for long enough, it will eventually result in Titans forming after years or decades. However, Worm-derived powers will still basically work, as they did after Gold Morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf another ascended power 'stops' the Force, Force-users like Dooku will no longer be able to see into the far future, but will retain other Force powers. Basically, if the Force is being 'stopped' by another ascended power, it won't be able to work its Will on the scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- - -\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe orkz will not think anything of being deposited on Earth Bet and will happily start krumpin' and WAAAGH!in' like normal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCount Dooku will instantly know that something has gone wrong, sensing a massive disturbance in the Force. Since he does not has access to the star charts for the Milky Way galaxy needed to safely plot interstellar Star-Wars-type hyperspace jumps, he will not be able to safely travel outside the solar system, however, he will be able to easily relocate his forces to anywhere in the solar system, and may choose to set up his droid factory on Earth Bet or any other planet or moon in the Earth Bet solar system, which will take about a month. His droid factory, once set up and functioning, will be able to produce 1 CIS starship per month, as well as 10,000 B2 super battle droids and 100,000 B1 battle droids per week. This factory will not be able to create new vulture droids or droideka.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGeneral Martok will initially think that Earth Bet is the Maquis world he was sent to conquer. The Vulcan spy will know that Earth Bet is not the correct planet from the start, and being weakly psychic, will instantly become aware that there is some incredibly messed up shit going on in the general vicinity of this planet. As soon as any Klingon officer looks at the stars or the Bird-of-Prey's navigational array, he will quickly notice that they appear to be at Earth in what they think is the Star Trek Milky Way galaxy. However, since they are not in the Star Trek universe, they will not be able to contact any Star Trek factions. The Dominion shapeshifter will likewise try to contact Dominion HQ and will fail. If he decides to leave the solar system, General Martok will not find any other life in the Milky Way galaxy that he would expect to find in the Star Trek version of the Milky Way galaxy, no Federation, no Klingon Empire, no Romulans, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStargate's Thor will attempt to contact Stargate Command, but will find that there is no stargate currently located under Cheyenne Mountain, and no SGC. Preliminary scans will reveal that something really fucked up must have happened to Earth since the last time he was there, with Japan underwater and a constantly exploding Ash Beast roaming around Africa and a bunch of other battle scars that will be frighteningly visible from space. The Ascended Ancient that arrived with Thor will immediately try to 'stop' one other ascended power, but she won't be able to stop all of them, so she'll have to decide which one is the 'worst' and focus on stopping that one. There are no stargates anywhere in the Worm/Ward universe for this scenario, but Thor retains the knowledge of how they are constructed, and even though naquadah doesn't naturally occur, he has the ability to synthesize stable transuranic elements and could theoretically make some stargates if he wanted to for some reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGladiator, who has never been to Earth before, will not swiftly notice that he is in a different universe, and will begin searching for his Queen, but his search will be in vain. He expects that she will be able to psychically contact him, so if he fails to hear her, he may assume that she is dead, in stasis, or no-longer on Earth. Under normal circumstances, the Worm-entities would be extremely interested in Gladiator's biology, but Zion is currently depressed and doesn't care about anything. The Simurgh will likely be intensely interested in Gladiator, however, as he may be capable of providing her creator, Eidolon, with a worthy opponent. If Gladiator leaves the Earth Bet solar system, he will not find any of the normal Marvel space factions he would expect to find in his own universe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVivec will continue sitting on his giant asteroid orbiting the Earth. If something knocks the asteroid out of its orbit, it will crash into the Earth, killing almost all life, except for certain powerful individuals. Who knows what Vivec would do if something bothered him? Presumably he'd do whatever he felt like doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Nihilanth will have the same motivation as in Half Life: he's trying to save Xen from the Combine by allowing his forces to escape to Earth. If the Nihilanth dies and the Combine get involved, they will have the same goal as in Half Life 2: combine the species of Earth and Xen into the Combine and continue expanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDragon, the Worm/Ward AI, will instantly become aware of all the new arrivals, as well as the Warp rift above the planet, thanks to her satellite network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Simurgh can fly in space, as we saw in Worm, and can try to directly interact with any of these newcomers, if she wants to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the sake of the scenario, the Klingon's universal translators continue to work just fine, and the other newcomers can speak some version of English that can be roughly understood by every other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince shards/passengers can attach themselves to non-humans like the AI, Dragon, or the dog in Ward, any of the newcomers with physical bodies and brains/CPUs may gain Worm/Ward style powers if they have a trigger event. For the sake of fun, we're going to say this applies to Star Wars droids, even B1's, as well as orkz, but since orkz don't get upset easily, probably the only thing that could cause an ork to have a trigger event would be if he got stuck somewhere for a long time without any hope of seeing battle ever again, or something like that. However, since the newcomers aren't normal humans, they might have a higher chance of experiencing broken triggers, like the dog from Ward. Up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich of these characters are most likely to get triggers? Who has suffered the most abuse and is the most mentally unstable?\n\n\\-General Grievous, probably? Grievous is not exactly a 'happy camper.'\n\n\\-Durge spent hundreds of years going insane at one point, so maybe him?\n\n\\-The sheer number of B1 and B2 battle droids, and the way they are constantly abused, makes it likely that some of them will have triggers.\n\n\\-If the constant ambient psychic suffering from Earth Bet seriously affects the Vulcan spy, Vutoc, it might drive him crazy enough to have a trigger event.\n\n\\-If the Klingons realize that the Klingon Empire is gone and they are 'the only Klingons left in the universe,' would that cause triggers? Maybe among a few.\n\n\\-If the Dominion Founder comes to believe that it is the only remaining one of its kind in the universe, and that it will never again rejoin the Great Link, that will almost certainly cause an emotional state that could result in a trigger event.\n\n\\-If Thor's ship started getting eaten by Replicators, could it panic and have a trigger event?\n\n\\-Can Replicators have trigger events? Replicators display distributed cognition, so could a large group of distressed Replicators have a single trigger event? What would that even look like?\n\n\\-If Gladiator believes he will never find his Queen, and that he failed in his mission to rescue her, that might not only weaken his native powers, but it may act as the basis of a trigger event.\n\n\\-Enslaved Vortigaunts appear to be having a very not-fun time in Half Life, so they're probably great candidates for trigger events.\n\n\\-People who become headcrab zombies continue being awake and suffering even as the headcrabs puppet their bodies around, which is presumably a very good precondition for a Worm/Ward trigger event. For that matter, what happens to Worm/Ward capes who get turned into headcrab zombies? For the sake of the scenario, we will say that the resulting headcrab zombie retains the powers of the cape, but the powers can only be used in a reduced capacity, and tinker powers probably won't work at all. However, if the cape's trigger event was in any way similar to being controlled by a headcrab-like entity, then that will cause their powers to become more powerful than ever.\n\n\\-If the Combine get involved and start 'augmenting' humans, you can bet those humans will be having trigger events left and right, have you seen Combine Stalkers? The various enslaved Combine races, including potentially their vehicles, might also be in a lot of distress, and might end up getting trigger events. Imagine a Combine Dropship, Gunship, Tripod, or Hunter with a Worm/Ward superpower. I don't think the Spore Launcher alien is having a fun time being force-fed ammunition which it is then forced to explosively vomit. What I'm asking is: how aware is a Bulimia Bug of its situation, and could it have a trigger event? These are questions that require answers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCharacters I'd guess would be unlikely to undergo trigger events would include Count Dooku, General Martok, G-Man, and Thor, since they all seem very well-adjusted and unflappable (especially Thor, that little gray man is the chillest guy ever), but who knows what emotional turmoil lurks in these men's hearts? It all just depends what happens to them, and what kind of bad situations they're forced into. Who might experience triggers, and what might they're resulting powers be, is entirely up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Simurgh will still be mainly focused on preserving the cycle and providing a worthy opponent to Eidolon. Fortuna (Contessa) will still be mainly focused on assembling the forces required to destroy Zion. The two other Endbringers, Behemoth and Leviathan, are still alive at this time, and unless an Endbringer dies in this new scenario, the other Endbringers will not be created. Unless something major happens right away (like, say, the space hulk crashing on top of New Dehli), Behemoth will still attack New Dehli, as he did in the original Worm timeline, and Zion will still be willing to kill Endbringers, as he was in the original timeline. However, that doesn't mean events have to happen the same way they did in Worm. If something kills an Endbringer for some reason, regardless of which one, Eidolon will start accidentally creating new Endbringers in the order he did before, starting with Khonsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll forces will continue to have their normal motivations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- - -\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's going to happen? Who will end up dominating this scenario? Obviously it could go almost any way, depending on what little random things happen at the start, and, especially, whatever the long-range precogs like the Simurgh, Fortuna, Eidolon, Glaistig Uaine, Count Dooku, and G-Man decide to do early on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would happen, and who would win?",

                    "text": "I'd say, short term, Vivec, and Thor, and Martok, and Gladiator all leave. Dooku leaves as well, but slower as he has to remake star charts before he can go to hyperspace. They gotta find their friends and see what's going on. The Orks, the daemons, the Nihalanth, and all the Worm people start fighting on Earth. Mostly everybody vs Orks and Daemons, because that's how the Orks and Daemons like it.\n\nA month later, not finding anybody, Dooku orders his ships to land and set up shop on a nearby uninhabited planet. The Orks and Daemons are mostly contained, at great cost to the Worm people. The planet is now thoroughly infested with both Ork spores and Chaos corruption, and is doomed no matter what. Vivec just relaxes and watches the crazy, or blips himself back to a more familiar place, he can do that because he's Vivec. Martok is just kinda screwed. Gladiator too. He could come smoke the whole planet, but... why? He's likely to just keep popping in and out of the Warp trying to find a way back to his Earth. Thor spends his time frantically looking for help and a way to keep the Replicator contained, so he's not going anywhere near Earth once he realizes they can't help.\n\nTriggers... Could happen all over. But I imagine the snotlings and grotlings come out ahead. Orks are super happy to keep fighting, but they spend their in-between fight times beating the snot out of the snotlings. Then they find out it can cause triggers, and turn the snotlings into superweapons. Now its even more fun!\n\nA few months in, with thousands upon thousands of triggered snotlings being used as living weapons by Orks (who have no problem being vaporized by the dozens in the process of making them), the Worm people start to lose. Daemons continue to spread their influence, and Chaos cults begin forming. The Nihalanth decide this is NOT the world to escape to, and begin working to close the portals. \n\nA year in, the Earth is mangled. Megapowered snotlings run amok, Chaos cultists spread among the remaining humans. The Nihalanth don't manage to close all the portals, because everybody is now charging through them into their worlds to escape the Orks and Chaos and constant warfare, and tossing a crowbar into the plans. And around now Dooku realizes he has only one planet available to conquer with his now millions of battle droids, with a droid factory well beyond reach of any forces still existing on Earth. Martok and Thor either team up with him, or are destroyed. \n\nThe Nihalanth are defeated by the Combine, who proceed to stomp their way back onto Earth through those portals, and run into the Chaos and Ork insanity. When they realize the corrupting powers of Chaos, they NOPE their way right back out. If they make it in time, they survive unscathed. If not, the Chaos corrupts them and spreads through another universe... Or if Dooku + Friends realize what's going on, they get Martok to toss his world breaker bomb through a portal. \n\nDooku uses his droids to try and reconquer Earth. They have varying levels of success, especially in combination with orbital bombardments, but eventually he realizes that removing the Ork infestation may be impossible. Fortunately, endless droids can keep stamping them out once they get reduced to manageable numbers, and any triggered ones can get vaporized from orbit. Same with the rain of Daemons.\n\nThings seem pretty good for whoever is still alive at this point... until hanging out next to an open portal directly to the warp, directly in the gaze of 4 Chaos Gods, starts to wear down everybody. Dooku eventually falls, and starts worshipping one. Likely Tzeentch, with all the forbidden knowledge and such. This lasts for a while, until he eventually is so corrupted he morphs into Saruman, and reevaluates the Ork army, and decides to overthrow his dark master...\n\nWith the power of his new forbidden knowledge, he locates Thor, who is hiding with his ship which is nearly out of power. Saruman defeats Thor, seizes the Replicant, and hurls it into the Warp... Chaos stops being quite so Chaotic, as the Replicants slowly turn it into a nice orderly bunch of gray goo. \n\nAnd then we find out this was the G-Man's plan the whole time.",

But an Ork kan neva loze bcaz evin if Orkz die dey die krumpin. Orkz is orkz!\n\nIn reality: it doesn’t matter who has the strongest guns or the strongest troops or how numerous or anything. The green tide comes all the same. The thing about Orkz is that they reproduce by dying since they’re fungus. So if you kill literally the entire Ork force, if you didn’t do a good job burning every single cell that comprises and Ork, they will just take root on the planet and produce more orkz. And it’s almost a guarantee you will not get rid of them with that many of em running around. They could be the first taken out of the whole war, but they will be back for the winner bigger and badder, and they will only grow more numerous. And that’s a guarantee. Orkz love to fight, that’s their reason for living, breathing, and existing. So it’s just a matter of time before they come looking for another good krumpin.\n\nPlus- they posses an incredibly powerful psychic field as a collective horde. If they all believe something hard enough then it comes true. For instance- they think painting their vehicles red makes them faster, so they are faster. They think painting themselves purples turns them invisible and it does turn them invisible, because you’ve never seen a purple Ork before. They think that painting themselves black makes them stronger, so it DOES. Orkz weapoms don’t even work conventionally! The only reason they do is because they believe they do. There have been plenty of situations where a human or enhanced human have picked up Ork weapons and tried to use them and they just straight up don’t shoot. Same thing with their vehicles.\n\nOrkz are way too broken. Because if they survive a good krumpin they win, but if they die they still win because they went out krumpin, and that’s all that matters to an Ork.",

The Mad Star inspired the moon to hurl itself upon Vivec's new city, which Sheogorath claimed was built in mockery of the heavens. When Vivec learned of Sheogorath's scheme, he froze the rogue moon in the sky with a single gesture and the grace of his countenance.\n\n>https://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_Pilgrim's_Path\n\nAlso look back above it said it is from Oblivion\n\n>I’ve heard of it,” Attrebus said. “It was considered a wonder of the world.

The mighty Fa-Nuit-Hen, a servant of Hermaeus Mora? By no means! I am a scion of Boethiah, a sovereign demiprince, and I serve no will but my own! As for time, cause, and consequence, let's just say that the laws of the Dragon God do not apply to Oblivion. Oh, it's useful to adopt the trappings of duration when dealing with mortals, so you'll find Maelstrom quite familiar in that regard.

The sea of limitless dimensions contains an endless series of islands. Some are controlled by the mighty Daedric Princes; others are loosely connected to one minor Daedra Lord or another. On these islands, creatures dwell who possess secrets out of time.\n\n>https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Rulantaril%27s_Notes\n\nAlso vivec transcend concept of time is all Gods in Elder Scrolls nature is beyond concepts space and time and live in Timeless world were is everything always happening all at once, and when they ,Die, and they can just wake up like it was dream and then they are a life again.\n\n>the Dwemer: \"I have no idea what happened to the Dwemer. I have no sense of them in the timeless divine world outside of mortal time. And, in fact, if I did believe they existed, I would be in no hurry to make contact with them. They may, with some justice, hold the Dunmer race responsible for their fate. My intuition is that they are gone forever -- and that is perfectly fine with me\n\n>Continue.....\n\n>It is a bit like being at once awake and asleep. Awake, I am here with you, thinking and talking. Asleep, I am very, very busy. Perhaps for for other gods, the completely immortal ones, it is only like that being asleep. Out of time. Me, I exist at once inside of time and outside of it\n\n>Continue.....\n\n>It's nice never being dead, too. When I die in the world of time, then I'm completely asleep. I'm very much aware that all I have to do is choose to wake. And I'm alive again. Many times I have very deliberately tried to wait patiently, a very long, long time before choosing to wake up. And no matter how long it feels like I wait, it always appears, when I wake up, that no time has passed at all. That is the god place. The place out of time, where everything is always happening, all at once\n\n>https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vivec_(god)\n\nVivec already take the player outside Time itself.\n\n>Don't be alarmed.

Synchronicity comes out of repeated coincidences at the lowest level. Further examination shows it is the utter power of the sheer number of coincidences that leads one to the idea that synchronicity is guided by something more than chance. Therefore, synchronicity ends up invalidating the concept of the coincidental, even though they are the symptomatic signs that bring it to the surface.'\n\n>Thus was coincidence destroyed in the land of the Velothi\n\n>https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_4\n\nVivec can remake the World just for a game ( stated by Word of God )\n\n>Gavin Dady: I mean some of the other ones...talking about Morrowind for instance...those people say \"I would love an Almalexia and Sotha Sil\" and things like that. Like yeah but...\n\n>Pylan: How do you add a god into...\n\n>Gavin Dady: How do you put that into a skirmish game, you know? It doesn't fit in.\n\n>Pylan: Yeah, Vivec just shows up and Vivec and just recreates the world and then the skirmish is over.\n\n>Gavin Dady: Yeah...exactly yeah.\n\n>https://youtu.be/L0N5Fm2R4d4 [20:21]\n\nAlso it have said vivec have destroy world with single hand\n\n>It is said the number is the number of birds that can nest in an ancient tibrol tree, less three grams of honest work, but Vivec in his later years found a better one and so gave this secret to his people.\n\n>For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand is how it could have won against me.

Now that is a great secret indeed, a mystery your Lord Vehk unraveled only after prolonged hallucination upon Premeditated Modesty.

It was so bright that it was seen across infinite layers of Clockwork city , which is how Barbas found it. Keep in mind that the Clockwork City is infinite Multiverse said, so it would take infinite energy to light it up\n\n>Barilzar: So Sotha Sil's forgotten tool was modified to steal Vivec's energy, which in turn energized the Clockwork City.
